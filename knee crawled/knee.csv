"Knee replacement 10 days ago!! It is such early days yet. I wonder if anyone/hospital gave you any information or idea of what to expect after the op?
I had mine 11 weeks ago now. I was seen at pre-op clinic, all info was given and an in depth booklet of information for before and after surgery answering 99% of the things that you might worry or ask about.
I would certainly mention the deep pain/ache in your leg to GP/Hosp just to rule out any problem. I can only go on my experience as everyones circumstances/recovery may be different.
In early weeks like you I felt quite a lot of pain and it would go down my shin bone but mostly pain was around knee itself. I found it hard to sleep for long I was in/out bed at least three times a night not knowing where to put the leg for total comfort. I found taking my painkillers at regular times was a great help and doing last of physio exercises about an hour before bed and then sitting with the Ice Packs given from the hospital on the knee to cool it down after physio - to help sleep I would lie on my ""good side"" put a pillow between my knees so the bad knee was comfortable or lie on back, put a pillow under bad knee its just comfort for a while but as the weeks go on it gets better. I only started to sleep without pillow at 8 weeks and was sleeping for about 4 hours now I am sleeping for approx. 6+ still a little restless. Each morning I feel like the knee has seized up and takes a while to get going but I do exercises bending knee etc and its fine after about half hour. If I sit for too long it seizes up and I have to stand for a second or so before moving off. I am still going to Physio as I don't seem to have enough bend on the knee and its still really painful to do also I cant go down stairs easily yet too painful. It is a long process so don't despair you will get there.
Are you doing leg exercises? use Ice pack or peas (can burn skin) wrap in a tea towel. Use after exercises it will take the swelling down and feels good.
GO AND ASK ABOUT THE PAIN IN YOUR LEG

"I had a T KR in November of last year very painful and was in intensive care for 4 days, I then had many physio sessions....then in January of this year a had a manipulation as the knee was not bending sufficiently....in April I had two more manipulations and arthroscopic surgery thinking yes! This is finally going to be OK but no still having physio after in excess of 55 sessions........it is still only bending to just and I mean just 90 degrees still far from sufficient movement, I have been unable to drive also since last November .....so now we have had to change our car to accomodate my problem .....NOT. ON .....but had to be done....I am now waiting next week to have a nuclear scan on my knee to see why????? Insufficient movement.....and it is almost certain for another TKR which I can assure you I am not looking forward to.........has anyone else had this problem ? Thankyou for any help or replies .

I had TKR right knee 4sept last year and still have pain swelling and bruising
There's still a lot of bruising
i spent 9 days in hospital due to horrific bruising from the bottom half of my stomach to right underneath my foot and a fall the day after the op
physio was useless I only had 5 sessions which I truly think was nowhere near enough
I have to see my Surgeon again on the 25th this month and he said last time that if it was no different he would investigate further
i still don't sleep very well and wake every time I shift my knee to another position
im fed up now

"I'm sure you will read, and have read, that every person is difference in their recovery. I am 5 and a half weeks post op. I started physical therapy 3 days after my surgery. It was so painful I cried the first couple of times but it does get easier. My best advice to you is to do the exercises, especially lifting the leg and bending It. I was driving after 2 and a half weeks but drive an automatic. I was off crutches also at 2 and a half weeks. I do physical therapy 3 times a week and am making great progress. I can bend the knee to 120, stand on just the surgery leg for 1 minute sessions, am going up and down steps but with pain going down. The first 12 days were hell for me as pain was so intense but it eased after that. I still have some pain and swelling but it's so much betier now. Currently I have an abscess where one of my stitches poked thru the skin and am treating that with peroxide and antibiotic ointment. Sleeping is still dufficult. In the early days I slept on my back with my foot elevated and ice off and on. Now I sleep I need my side with a pillow between my knees and can sleep for about 2 hours before I have to change positions. It DOES get easier but takes time. Don't get discouraged! This forum is a great place to compare recoveries, ask questions, get answers and for emotional support and encouragement. Hang in there. Take your pain med school regularly. I wish you luck!!

"Wow! Your note here could not be more timely. I am one week post TKA and have a hundred questions and cautions going thru my mind. Ive experienced constant knee pain of varing degree depending on range of pain meds. I have experienced similar inability to get comfortable especially at night. Restful sleep has not happened. My #1 concern is that I will require manipulation surgery because I can not break thru the swelling to bend my knee to 90 degrees and I am still laying on my back 24/7 Can anyone comment?

Thank you for your wonderful response to your experience during this long and sometimes painful process. LOL
I am having a TKR on Wednesday, and I am anxious and looking forward to hopefully being able to walk without so much pain on the other side of my recovery.
I am sure that the initial process will be painful, and it's good to know that if a few tears are shed, I won't be alone.
I will keep you all posted on my recovery and look forward to the Forum of Support.

"Hi Charlotte 81954 don't despair, I know how hard it is. I am glad that you can do most of the exercises.
My TKR was 13 days ago. I was very disappointed in my recovery progress. I placed too much pressure on myself to progress rapidly, as I had read others had. Today is the first day at PT that I felt good about my progress. I don't have issues with my thigh muscles now. However I don't think I had significant control until this past weekend (11 days). If you are like me once the inflammation goes down you will see significant progress. Please don't push yourself more than your body wants. I made the mistake of pushing myself real hard looking for success. All that did was to create a setback as my knee was aggravated by the excessive exercising. My knee became enraged, stiffened up and had significant swelling. Rest, take your medication as prescribed, try to do your exercises reasonably. If it hurts too much then listen to your body. Once your swelling goes down a good portion of the pain goes with it. My knee still cannot bend as much as I would like it to but that is my focus now. I can straighten it but to bend it back is difficult.
It is still somewhat difficult for me to sleep through the night. However it is much better now than just the past couple of days. I generally wake a couple of times with sharp or throbbing pain in my knee. If I take my medication before I go to sleep it helps significantly. When I awake, I ice and if the time is correct I take my pain medication again. Don't try to tuff it out! The medication was prescribed for a reason, use it. It will help you to get a better night sleep which makes everything seem a bit brighter.
Good Luck!

"Hi Charlotte!
I had the same problem! My left leg LITERALLY felt like a tree trunk filled with CEMENT!
My physical therapist who came to my home while I was homebound had me loop one of my husband's belts to make a kind of lasso which I would then slide my foot into like a stirrup on a horse. I could THEN use the long strap end to maneuver my leg wherever I wanted it to go.
This worked GREAT to get my leg onto the bed, onto the ottoman, and onto the couch once I had sat down on the couch and wanted to elevate my legs.
After awhile with exercises I could move my leg much better because I built up my quad muscle.
Try the belt loop thing! It really made a HUGE difference and built independence, too!

"Haha! Yeah it REALLY sucks not having any strength in you leg.
I'm almost 4 weeks post-op right now. You'll see great improvement in weeks 2-3.
I can stand alone on my surgical leg indefinitely now, walk without assistance (although I have ditched the walker and now use a cane), and most importantly can lift my leg!
Just keep trying. It will come. Guaranteed.

"Clicking is not something to worry about and will fade with time.
Only 4 weeks post-op but have been very lucky. I was up and walking within 4 hours of surgery using a walker (rollator) . Went home on the 2nd day and switched to a cane for only outside walking. Walking unassisted now, can navigate stairs and have 119 degrees range already. My only problem now is swelling which at times seems excessive and very painful, but I'm totally off all pain medications.
My advice is EXERCISE, EXERCISE AND EXERCISE. Work through the pain, use an ice machine after working out for 15 minutes.
I'm 64 years old, have Lupus and RA, Fibromyalgia too. But other than the degree of pain associated with TKR (right knee) I have been amazed at how quickly I'm getting around. Still not allowed to drive, 2 more weeks, but with proper pain medications, a constant range motion machine after surgery and the ice machine, I'm well on the way to a total recovery.

"I had surgery 15days ago. I was also worried about the bending issue, my swelling was terrible and I was not able to get 90 degree until this week. My advice is ice it under knee and from upper thigh to just below knee area. I also take Allieve to help, that did bring my swelling down enough to work more on my bending still hurts like heck but power through it and you will get there.

"I've had mine done 3 weeks ago and the pain was really bad it is in my shin now .I find it hard to sleep due to sciatic pain now so on amatriptilyne to help . I was struggling to walk etc but I keep doing exercises I now have a 120 degree but I am struggling to get a straight leg lift though . The pain is intense and burning from my knee where the quads join but I still have carry on lifting . My straight leg is still a bit forward so I was told by the physio to elevate the leg on a stool straight out and place some oven gloves across my knee with tins of beans in the hand bits and let gravity do its work. It does work and is uncomfortable but only do little and often
. My knee is clunking a bit and I thought it would be smooth has anyone else had this ?doc says it should settle down but I'm not convinced. It's a long haul with this op which totally underestimated

"I am 3 months post knee reolacement. I still have moderate swelling. My knees both click and pop during walking. I thought it would be smoother but the dr says it's normal. I did water aerobics and a jacuzzi for my rehab along with my dr prescribed lifts and bends and have good ROM. Jacuzzi was helpful in bending the knee. I don't feel like I shapes back as quickly as some and have difficulty walking smoothly. Can not carry anything heavy during my walk and length of time standing in one place is not very long. My Dr says it's all normal and will take about a year to feel normal. Forums are a great place to see how others are doing to measure your own progress and what is normal. Sleeping is hard for me now. Very restless. I have to take a sleep aid to help. Hopefully that won't be forever.

"Cindy,
A TKR is one of the most painful surgeries a person can have. All of us feel bad about your pain and can empathise with you too. Do you have someone to help you? Don't hesitate to call the district nurses or NHS 24 if you need them out of hours. They are fantastic people and they are there to help you. I've had to call them several times, now. Use lots of ice to get the swelling down and although it seems trivial, wiggle your toes often and do your exercises when you can. I'm not a person who cries much but I've done a lot of crying with this one. If you can't sleep at night try to rest during the day if you can. Keep posting and tell us how you're doing as the days go by. Little improvements make us all happy. We wish you well. An NHS 24 doctor got my pain under control and I am extremely grateful to him.

"Thanks very much Margaret and Debbie. I can now see that I was being very optimistic! I read all the stuff about what to expect but I still didn't expect this inability to sleep etc. I've spoken to the hospital and was told to take paracetamol and codeine 4 times a day and Diclofenac 3 times a day, and to put ice (not frozen peas!) on my leg for 20 min sessions. I've been doing that, more or less, anyway, but maybe an extra Diclofenac (I was only taking 2 per day) and ice instead of frozen peas, will do the trick!! Anyway, I now realise I was expecting far too much too soon. Thanks again, and it hope your pain disappears very soon.

"Hi everyone - I had a unicompartmental medial knee replacement on 20th March. I am having real problems with the bending of my knee. They said at hospital that I had to have a 90degree bend before they would discharge me but I failed this target miserably and went home anyway on day 4. I have now been home a week and am still not quite reaching the 90 bend - it feels hot and like my knee will explode when I get to the limit of where it wants to bend to. On Thursday this week I have to have my staples removed and am really nervous about this - how did any of you find/cope with this? One of the really worst things I found in hospital was having the drain removed...did you find this??? Sorry to bombard with questions...

"Hi everyone
its one month since my TKR and finding this forum has been so welcome. I had a booklet but no one told me how painful my leg would be. I have had one physio session and told I was trying to do way too much, but I thought the more I pushed the knee the quicker it would recover! Sleep is also my biggest challenge and chronic tiredness doesn't help my mood, I have also been told the hip needs replacing soon but really worried about coping with this type/ level of pain again! My scar feels very tight and even with cream and massage it doesn't help!! Any hints would be most welcome.

"Hi Lynne!
I am 11 weeks post op from my TKR. I have my other knee replacement on Oct. 9th.
What helps me the most is taking naps when I get tired instead of fighting it. A half hour of REALLY good sleep when I am truly tired is better than TRYING to sleep at night when pain seems to be greater.
Taking a good multivitamin that has 100% of the daily recommended dose of iron also helps with being more energetic instead of tired.
I like to move around a lot throughout the day to keep loose. This helps the PAIN and makes me less stiff. I find that stretching to increase my BEND helps to loosen my incision area and break up scar tissue. I ease gently into EVERY stretch then hold it for 30 seconds.
I stretch in bed before my feet ever touch the floor. This helps me balance as I get out of bed and makes those first few stiff minutes easier.
Be sure to keep hydrated. Also 2000 mg. of Omega 3 (fish oil gels) help with the joints. If I forget to take them or run out of them I can tell the difference.
I haven't had a hip replacement, but people I have talked to that have had knees and HIPS REPLACED have ALL said HIPS are easier than knees.
Be patient. Around six weeks I think you will find that everything starts to get easier.
Rest when you can, and do good breathing in and out to get oxygen to your body. When we are in pain we tend to breathe in a very shallow way.
Best wishes to you as you continue your recovery!

"You are very welcome!
You learn a lot if you listen to your body. A lot of the time that's hard to do because we humans are REALLY IMPATIENT and want results and improvements IMMEDIATELY!
I am learning to accept that some days will be better than others, flexibility will vary, swelling comes for no apparent reason and often leaves for no apparent reason as well, and some days I have oodles of energy while on other days I am a LAZY LUCY.
I DO take my temperature often. I get high fevers if I DO get a fever and often don't realize I am already at 100° if I go without taking my temperature. One thing I DON'T ever want to do is ignore a possible infection. That could cause all kinds of trouble with a knee replacement or ANY replacement.

"Hi Lynne,
I would like to second what Cheryl has said. I am 32 days post tkr. It has been horrendous but is getting better. I go to pt 3x a week and do exercises at home. Maybe not as often as I should, but I make sure to do them. Massaging my knee with vitamin e oil a few times a day and keeping it iced. I am to go back to work in 7 days and am a bit anxious about it. I now use only a cane to get around and it does get easier every day.
I think the sleep problems and aching bother me the most.
Good luck to you with your recovery!

"HI Wendysk8128. Having my drain removed was nothing, but 24 staples removed was not fun. The removal itself would have been easier if the P.A. would have paid more attention to what she was doing. She kept catching my skin with the staple remover when pulling to remove the staples. OUCH!
Watch when they remove each staple. Make sure no skin is pinched in the puller!
I had a quick recovery in regard to movement, I was at 120 degrees by 6 weeks post surgery, however, I have a terrible problem with severe swelling. Went for an ultrasound and no blood clots thank goodness, just it looks twice the size of my other leg. It's also very stiff, but the more I walk and do my exercises the better it feels, until it swells again. Elevation and lots of ice for me. I thought by 14 weeks I would be as good as new, but I'm told I could have stiffness and swelling for 12 months! Glad I had it done, but if the other knee needs replacing, I'll really have to be in agony before doing this again.

I have had a total knee replacement!

"Some people tend to have such a high pain threshold. I went to PT today and I felt like screaming and the exercises weren't all that drastic. I have wondered if some people, by nature, just take longer to recuperate and cope with the bending and stretching. I could not face this again and I am use to a lot of pain from migraines and arthritis for 45 years.

"Yes everyone is different. Don't compare yourself to any one else. Everyone's healing time is different. I am 1 year out and have learned to just focus on my own recovery and do what I can. I rehabbed myself and wished I would've had rehab done. It is super painful but on this side of it, It's all worth it. Take your pain meds, bring your ice bag worked hard and ice it when your done. I did a lot of Jacuzzi therapy and bent my knee hard, I think that was the key to my success. I'm not pain free but I would definitely do it again. My heel doesn't touch my rear but Im close. I had both done and had complications with each one so I was a hard case. But today, no more throbbing or aching from arthritis. Just dealing with swelling a bit. This time will pass and you will be feeling better. Give yourself about 6 months and then each month gets better.

"Hi Wendy. I can't help much about the 90deg bend as I wasn't required to do that before I left hospital after 3 days. My knee, however, was very hot and swollen for a long time. It still gets warm. Were you told to put ice bags on it? It's now gradually going down ( I had my op a week before you) but is by no means comfortable. I had stitches (allergic to most metals) and even tho I was concerned about what would happen, it was fine when they came out. My knee is gradually bending more and I'm sure yours will be fine after a while. Good luck

"hi wendy , I too was supposed to have a 90degree bend and again I didn't when I left ,keep up with the ice and exercises , your knee will feel hot but not too hot as that could be an infection I did at about 10 days and felt rough . I had strange stitches with just a knot at each end ,so when the nurse came to take them out she just snipped each end , there was nothing else to see but over the weeks I can feel them tugging then snapping inside my knee ( this was not at all painful ) .so when you lose your staples you will find it I little easier evey day or so , take your time and don't rush it will come ,6 weeks on and ive finished with physo and do my exercises at home and now have a bend of 115 degrees , just don't be too hard on your self ,I am also only 52 and did 2 miles swimming every day to help before the opp , it will come xx

"Hi Wendy I had my TKR 6th December 13 Yes they do get you out of bed asap and doing physio its got to be done. Your knee will feel very swollen/tight for a while mine is still tight in the bend now 12 weeks post op. I am still having physio working on the bend. I seemed to be doing ok but then slipped back a bit and I was told by physio that a lot of patients stop when they feel the stretching/pain when doing physio but within reason you need to push through this pain so you get further each time to achieve maximum bend. I am just working on coming downstairs and how best to kneel. But even now every morning my knee feels like its gone three steps back and is tight and some discomfort until I get moving and do first lot of physio. I also still have an odd shape around the kneecap but was told that ""they only have certain sizes and it may always be slightly different than the other""!
Taking staples out - nothing to worry about slight twinge on maybe one or two if they are tight but certainly not pain. You will feel more comfortable after they are out. I still struggle a bit getting my left TKR into passenger side of car- don't physically lift your leg in - do it with muscle power, use them or lose them! Getting into bed can be painful- Sit as far onto bed as you can, at an angle towards the top of the bed- so that your bad knee will be first onto the bed- this way your Bad Knee will be nearly on the bed up to your thigh already and a bit easier to get onto bed fully. When dressing always put bad knee into trousers/underwear first. When sitting try to remember to bend the knee don't sit with it straight out 'cause you think it will hurt. Take a little bit of something from all of us and you will get there good luck it takes time.

"I had all 27 staples removed today - it really stung and pinched but a big relief to get them out. I had to have several steri strips put on as my scar is a bit of a mess. It is all puckered and different heights at varying points on either side of the wound. Also at a couple of points it started to pull apart slightly...so even longer until I can shower. I measured an 80 degree bend so not too bad as I can straighten and lift with no problem.

"Hi all, am I glad I found this forum. I am 7 days post op having TKR on 28th March, I have been feeling really
down in the dumps today because of the pain and stiffness in my leg. I had been to GP to have dressing
changed and felt I had over done it with the walking today.
All the conversations on here have reassured me that patience is a virtue, I was beginning to think something Was wrong!
I have so much swelling and bruising pariculary on my operated legs foot, my ankle is swollen and black with bruises. Behind my knee is painful and I am still unable to lift leg up from a sitting position, I can manage
about 3 inch of the floor. I am able to bare weight on my new knee, but am still on crutches to walk about. My hip on my unoperated side is also painful. So I am popping the recommended dose of tramadol and
paracetamol checking the time for my next dose.
I have had disposable sutures in which will fade away by next week. I am also in my early 50's and usually
very active and am finding it difficult to come to terms with my current disability.
I hope that each week I improve, I am doing the exercises given on discharge but am still waiting for my Physiotherapy appointment to come through. I was discharged on wednesday 2nd April, so I take it this is still very early days for me and I should just improve?
I have had very emotional day and been really upset with the pain, lack of mobility.
Thanks for listening and your support.

"Hi Wendy /Debbie
Thank you both for your replies .
It is so reassuring to have someone to ""chat too"" who knows what Im going through .
I have had a couple of comments made to me re my pain and stiffness intimating that i am putting this on and that ""by now i should be walking /sleeping pain free after a week"" as they were after their TKR . So as you can imagine i have dwelled on their comments and wondered if i should be!!
So listening to you all has reassured me.
I am currently on my 3rd wake up and pill stop of the night and its only 1.30am.
I do try and push myself but struggle afterwards .
I am still using the ice as my swelling is still painful .
I would appreciate if you would log your progress on here which i can build too this way i will have a goal to work too.
Thank you both again hope you sleep well.

"I have just had a knee replacement 11 days ago, was up walking same day. I vomitted for two days after the operation. The stiffness and bending the knee is my worst nightmare but I am getting there. Each day i wake up and its like starting all over again until I start to walk and after a few minutes it all loosens up again. I swore I wouldn't have it done again and am worried about having a second one in 15 years time as I am only in my 50's. My knee started to feel better before the op and I nearly cancelled but was talked into it by my doctor and as yet don't feel like saying thank you until it has cleared up. I got no information on the type of stitches I have nor have had the bandage changed yet. I do the exercises but not every day as it is too painful. This is certainly one of the most painful things I have ever gone through but I am told it will get better then I see people on forums saying after a year they are still in pain. The more one puts into getting better the better you will become and this is what i am doing, I am determined to get better. I take Solphdol before i go to bed and it knocks me out so I do sleep. I have found an edge on the bed where i can leave my bad leg without too much discomfort, but i do find a pillow between the legs more painful. Hope yours has now got much better.

"I too had my total knee replacement just 16days ago. I was up the same day but had a slight setback because I went dizzy and fainted due to low haemoglobin levels. I then was given 2 units of blood and put on iron tablets for 4 weeks. I had my dressing changed before I left hospital, after 4 days, and was given 2 spare dressings to take home for if I needed them before I went to my own doctors surgery to have the ends cut off my stitches. (The rest are dissolvable.)
i found it very difficult sleeping, both in hospital and once I came home so my doctor prescribed something to help me temporarily . I was both told at the hospital and read on my information booklet that this is normal post op. I am now sleeping about 5 hrs but once I wake up I need to get up as it is uncomfortable to stay in bed. I take my painkillers regularly and do my exercises as I know it all helps. Exercising does hurt but I find I can do more each day and I'm now walking with 1 crutch around the house but 2 when I go out.
the stiffness doesn't bother me too much, it's the pain at the sides of my knee and behind the knee that gets to me most. I find that massaging E45cream in and around the scar really helps.
i am feeling more positive that I am improving every day but I know I still have a long way to go.

"Hello Pegs. I've had the odd remark from someone suggesting I'm putting it all on, too, because they have a friend who's walking without crutches after 2 weeks etc! They have no idea how different knees can be, so ignore it!
I'm now getting on very much better. I have, in the main, only slight discomfort now, apart from the 'electric current' stabs I get, which I'm assuming is to do with nerves repairing. I'm walking around the house with no crutch, tho I use one for safety when I go out. Still don't walk very far. However, I'm feeling pretty pleased about things. It's still only just over 3 weeks since my op. So don't worry! Just one week has made a big difference and it will happen to you too! By the way, how long did you all keep wearing the sexy socks for?

How are you all doing ?
I went for my final dressing change yesterday and was impressed with how my scar is looking .
I have felt a lot better over the last few days and can see improvement on a daily basis . I woke Monday morning and the swelling had really gone down which enabled me to walk a bit better . So having these slight improvements as mentally helped.
I even managed a sneaky bath last night , getting in was better than getting out though .
I am still waking every couple of hours with the pain, and i also wake sweating and in such a lather , after being told to refrain from taking ny HRT a month pre op i can now re start it so all being well this will stop the hot flushes .
Hope you all have a good day and look forward to your updates .

I have finally slept the last 3 nights using piles of pillows as suggested by Ann xx(thanks!!!)
At physio yesterday, I managed the magic 90 degrees that they claimed I should have had 2 weeks ago on leaving hospital. My scar is a mess - it was very badly brought together with staples. It is all puckered and near the bottom of it has about an inch that is yet to heal. My pain is definitely improving and at least there is no creaking. I am certainly NOT having my other knee done until I am unable to move at all and even then I might still decline...
I am walking without crutches around the house but take crutches outside in order to help balance and warn others not to bump me xx
Looking forward to other people's updates xx

Your scar sounds nasty !! Hope it heals better. I didn't have staples i had soluble sutures which have all gone now and my wound is looking better and the scar a nice thin line albeit its not straight .
Don't make any hasty decisions re your other knee give it time ! I do though know how you feel, last week with everything going on i had thought about why id had this done .
Am sure it will get easier well i hope it does .
Lets hope some of the others who are well ahead of you/me post some updates this may help you keep positive .

"Hi Pegs. About those pillows!! If you just put them around your head and neck, your head gets pushed forwards uncomfortably. I wish I could draw how I put mine! I make a wedge shape from behind my lower back to the top of my head, so I'm leaning back on them. Use 3 or 4. I find too that it's much more comfortable to have 2 pillows under my legs, which stretch from under my knees along my calves. Just under the actual knee/s can make an uncomfortable lump which puts pressure on your knee - which, as we know, can be very painful. It all sounds a bit time-consuming and fussy to spend so much effort messing about with pillows, but when you get it right it's really worth it.
I now have very little real pain with my knee, apart from the electric shocky thing that I've decided is nerves repairing. I've got a long, untidy scar but I don't really care about that. I, too, originally decided I was going to get my other knee done very quickly after the first one, but I'm holding off a bit on that!! I'll get it done reasonably soon as it creaks and moans etc, but I'll wait til a few of the painful memories have faded first!
Good luck with the pillows.

"Hi Debb
Im doing great now thank you. I am still off work but am %90 there now. I had asset back with bursa behind knee which i have had a scan on and waiting results incidentally are on the 4th August . Hoping if i can get all clear i can return to work . You are brave having 2nd one done but if like me my attitude is no pain no gain . I KNOW now my TKR was worth it and feel i made right decision . Good luck for 4th at least you know what to expect !! Seems ages ago now since we all wimps after our ops

So glad its all over for you and how positive you sound. Its heaven being able to sleep through isn't it . I am fortunate that my left knee doesn't need doing ....yet! But have been told that the second one is easier as you know what to expect. Pleased for you.
Work was and still is hard going am on a phased return so doing less hours but still given full time projects to do in less time!! So i am shattered in bed before 7 each night. Had visitors tonight so its been a late one.
Keep up the great work..

"Hello again, honestly it is such early days for you ,it's tough for a few months and then you are suddenly surprised at your increased activity.
Swimming is fantastic, I still can't breaststroke tho.
keeping weight down has to be a long term project, no quick fix!
having said that I have just lost another stone on the 5/2 diet, google it, it's great!
carrying less weight has made a huge difference to how much I can do, can't emphasise it enough.
Wish they'd warned me at the time, they just said...you could do with losing a few pounds! I was 18 stone!
You will feel so much better soon, keep up the physio and exercise...you're right , things can only get better! And they will, for sure.
good luck

I understand your fears, i researched everything prior to my operation and was sorry i did as i found out too much!! However i am now 4 weeks post op and the pain has sunsided, the 1st couple of weeks i wont lie the pain was bad, however with the correct pain management from your GP it can be controlled, the only pain i have now is through the night when my knee is stiff, it odes wake me, i have had lots of advice from this Forum and hace taken it.
These Forums are great and have kept me going!!
Good luck with your Operation, once you get over the 1st couple of weeks you will see the light at the end of the Tunnel.

"Hi Ann, I'm from Sydney and I have just found this site. I'm 58 and had my TKR on 11th April. I had a unicompartment 10 years ago and ,my surgeon removed Iit for a full. I can relate to every post written here. Lack of sleep due to pain and being uncomfortable, the heat and the swelling, not being able to bend it enough. I have just started my physio as I had a set back with the wound and was not able to bend it for a while. I can deal with the pain etc but can't deal with generally feeling like crap!! I don't want to eat, I lost a few kilos ( i needed to anyway), but it seemed to drop off. I don't feel hungry and really can't be bothered. Has anyone else felt tlike that??

"My sister had your same issues. It was her meds. She lost 30 pounds in six weeks! Sounds great if you need to loose, but if not eating it just eats up muscle and energy. Once she was able to cut back on meds she began to feel much better. She is 5 months po and doing really good. Of course there is the pain and stiffness (swelling) if she over does, but can definitely see light at end of tunnel.
i find the confinement these last three weeks to be tough. I need to have my other knee replaced but have decided to wait until February. That way I am nine months po so should be feeling great and can enjoy through holidays before another confinement begins!

"Hello. It's Ann again. I had a second TKR a month ago. This time I wasn't expecting miracles in 10 days! This op was much more painful to start with but the pain has seemed to reduce more quickly. It's been difficult to bend as much as soon as the other one. Also I was on only one crutch around the house and went out with only one crutch for the first time yesterday, but was probably going a bit too fast across the road and got a sudden pain down the side of my knee which I still have. I'm hoping it will go soon and I'm back on two crutches!
I've found that using frozen peas on my knee a lot has helped with pain. I think I used them far more this time.
The first knee is pretty good now. It still gets warm and doesn't like being twisted, but the swelling has gone down and I can't say it's painful any more.
How long have you all been using crutches for? I can't remember how long I used them for last time.
I wear my stockings during the day but take them off at night. I reckon that as I take aspirin and my legs are up at night I'm probably ok.
Look forward to reading your emails.
Ann

Sitting in a chair isn't so bad but as soon as I'm horizontal it starts! My daughter gets a little relief by rubbing her feet on a rough surface and she also anoints her legs with Olbas Oil! Since my op I have been going to bed with ice packs on my feet! Not a pretty sight! I have taken Zolpidem sleeping pills for a few years as I really don't want strong drugs, they don't work all the time though and at the moment not at all. I often get up and have tea and toast, or cereal, and this seems to give the brain something else to think about and forget to send the twitchy impulses to the muscles!

"Hello O1nanny.
Sounds as if your family has been really taking you for granted! If I were you I'd ask them for as little help as possible now, but make sure I'm not as easily available when they want you to do something for them! Some of the way you feel is bound to be because of lack of sleep and pain, of course, as you said. But people don't realise that this operation is a big, painful one, and it takes a while to recover.
Anyway, that's not what this is about! After 10 days with my first knee I was feeling pretty fed up and worried about the pain/my progress etc, but it gradually got better and now, having had my second knee done about 6 weeks ago, I'm pleased that I had them both done. It DOES get better. Use ice (frozen peas) a lot. It helps more than you'd think. Good luck.

Everything went wrong with my operation, from the spinal block not working, and having to have a general on top! To a stupid nurse who read my file wrong and refused me painkillers all day, she was reading, every 1 hour as every 7 hours. To the physio who insisted forcing my sumo leg was a good idea.

You stick the patches on the upper body and the pain is alleviated for up to 72 hours before you replace it. I had to ask my specialist for this medicament as also had to stop taking NSAID'S.

"Well I have much enjoyed all the posts on here and they have certainly reinforced my own decision to never have my knee operated on! I had lunch today and a young waited was just 50 yesterday. He said he already has a lot of pain in his hips and knees through his work but is never going to have an operation and prefers to wait until he has no choice than a wheelchair. I feel the same. So many specialists seem to just recommend an operation and ignore that afterward you must face untold pain again and even worse than before, during lengthy rehabilitation. As my uncle used to say: I arrived with this lot and intend taking it with me when I pop off.

The hospital which do seem to ease the pain,I use them roughly every 3 hours
They told me I would be able to drive roughly after 6 weeks does anybody know
If this is about right .

"Hi Rick, you have been through it. One is bad enough but two at a time must be awful . At your stage pain and lack of sleep was all I could think of. I couldn't imagine a future without it. However at 7 weeks I sleep nearly through the night. For instance last night I must have turned badly and woke up with a severe pain. This often happens but the difference now is that I go straight back to sleep. I started driving at five weeks but wasn.t given the go ahead. I found out that there is no legal requirement to inform the DVLA after a tkr so as soon as I felt well enough I started driving again. However there were compelling reasons.and if I had any alternative I would have lelft it another week at least. If it had been my left knee I couldn't have coped with clutch control so I think you will have more challenges than most. Also no one should drive if they are taking opiate based medication. That would really be illegal at any time. Good luck.

Left of pain and lack of sleep then .Did you use exercise bicycle I did for a couple of days and think it made my calf muscles in both legs very
painful so stopped using it and pain in calfs now gone.Skin feels really
tight around both knees which also seems to make it harder to get some
Good bend above 90 degrees did you find this and when did it feel easier

"Hi Rick, I was dreading the bike at physio but found I could actually do a full circle for the first time in years so that really motivated me. I bought my own small 'wheely' on line and have used it ever since. It hurt at full bend but I graduallt found I could position itcloser to meand the bend got better. I had a marvellous surgeon who forced my bend fully two days after the op. I hated him then but now realise that he did me a big favour as I reached 115 after four weeks. It does really hurt when you push it, I shed many tears but it has been worth it compared to before the op.The stiffnes and pain in the knee itself is still there when I walk. It feels like abelt around it but I know from others on here that this is normal.I do feel as if I've hit a wall now and nothing is getting any better. I only take pain killers when I've over done it or if I know I'm going to do a lot more than normal. Looking back a couple of weeks that is an improvement. I'm going swimming today. I was given the go ahead for that two weeks ago but have been too busy moving house until now. I'm hoping that this will help me to loosen up. Will let you know. One of our tkr.s on here kept a diary and posted it as a blog. It helped me a lot as it coincided with my op. If he's still reading this a big Thank You. You will keep going forward so stay positive.

"Hello Rick,
recovery from a TKR does seem to be a bit of a lottery. Compared with others I have been in touch with, I seem to have got a short straw. However nearing 5 months after the operation things are definitely improving. Even if slowly. I do not need pain killers any more, but walking without a stick is decidedly awkward.
I was slow at getting a knee bend to and beyond 90 degrees. The breakthrough with that came when I found I could pedal a bike. I started off with the exercise bike in the physio gym, but that was rubbish as the saddle could only be adjusted in 1"" steps. I started to use a folding bike with a low step through and the saddle at a height where I could pedal with just a slight jerk at top dead centre. I gradually lowered the saddle over about a three week period and can now get 130+deg bend.
My leg does still feel odd though, sort of hangs down from my hip with this numb bit in the middle.
Never the less, I was driving ok after about 6 weeks. Perseverance is the answer, and not looking too closely at how others are doing. I dont think there are any hard and fast rules on recovery rate.

"I have severe shin bone pain. My surgery was 21 days ago. I was told to reduce my pain meds but Ive had to increase them again due to this horrible leg pain. I cannot sleep or relax or do anything except think about this pain. I have resorted to taking my 325 mg of hydrocodone and then taking it again as needed. I cant make it every six hrs. The pain is too intense. Beside the pain meds, try wrapping ice in a beach towel just below your knee when you are ready to sleep. Then prop your leg with pillows so your foot doesnt hang. Ive gotten a couple hrs sleep that way.

i maybe sleep for a couple of hours
i always sleep with my leg on Pillows
but after reading your post about the pillows so that your foot doesn't hang
I put pillows under the whole of my leg and it definitely eases the pain when the foot isn't hanging

"I just went to the doc. and he said the shin bone pain is from swelling in the leg. He gave me a prescription for Mobic, an anti-inflammatory. Today I also went to the massuesse and chiropractor. She gave me a light version of a shin splint massage. Then the chiropractor put me on the tens unit for ten minutes on the outside calf muscle. Doc also told me to keep wearing the compression socks. I feel like a new person. The anti-inflammatory is working and I know the massage and tens also worked. I know I'm gonna sleep tonight more than I have since my surgery. Give it a try!

"Hi, all. I'm so glad I found this site. I had total knee replacement 4 weeks ago. It's good to read how others are doing and all the different comments.
My knee seems quite stiff and it's still swollen, but it has gone done quite a bit since the surgery. All the odd pains throughout the leg at times, but I guess that's normal. Yes, it's difficult getting comfortable at night. I've done what some of the others have. I lie on the ""good"" side and put a contour pillow between my legs. Seems to help. I received physical therapy at home during the first week out of the hospital. After that, my husband has driven me to the appointments at the physical therapy center.
Good luck to all. I guess I'm an impatient patient, but it has been a pleasure comparing notes with others. Btw, I like a lot of the U.K. Internet sites for health information. I live in the U.S. (Chicago, IL), and I just find them a bit more thorough and, yes, interesting. Take care, all.

I had a 90 degree bend on discharge from hospital, but lost it very quickly and am now at 95. I have found using the Exercycle has been very helpful though can not walk far and still using one crutch. I find that the knee gets very hot and stiff when I try walking is this normal at this stage?

"I am also 10 days after my TKR. The surgeon also straightened my leg as it was quite badly bowed. I now have a beautifully straight leg that is probably half an inch longer now than my left leg ! The pain that first night was worse than anything I have encountered (even with the morphine !), and being someone that has always slept on his front , sleeping has been a big problem for me and getting comfortable in bed. But I was managing stairs at home alone after 3 days and walking unaided (without crutches or sticks) after 6 days (though not well of course). Am off painkillers now apart from one at bedtime and each day things seem to be getting easier. Bend I think is just past 90 degrees and am at physio tomorrow so will see they think I am progressing. Having been unsure what to expect before the op, I feel it has been better than I imagined. I am scheduled to have my second knee done middle april and now feel less trepidation about that. I held on as long as I could before getting the first one done (I was at hospital 8 years ago and the consultant told me that they had changed knees that were far better than mine - but I think living with the pain so long has perhaps given me a higher pain threshold). Reading everyone on here it is clear we are all different. I am 54 years (young !) by the way

"Hi Ann, I am in Oz but I think reading everyones post it is the same problems all over the World. My op was recent on November 7 so I am hoping you are running around by now. I like everyone else thought I was diferrent and would recover quickeer than anyone else, I was wrong, the pain in bed and the frequent wake ups are quite common it seems but when I went for my first catch up with my surgeon I told him of the pain when doing the physio and said we can cure that and he prescribed the Panadol Forte (with the codeine in it ). The change was great and sleep a lot better and the pain when doing the physio considerably reduced. Why didn't the hospital prescribe them in the first place? One of the key recovery factors is to have discussions with the physio guys and tell them where you have problems, it seems there is not a muscle that exists that they haven't got an excersise to stregthen.
Other points to mention Staple removal: not overly painfuy and most people seem to need a styrostrip somewhere, Scar looks really ugly: but it just seems to improve fairly quickly, I had a small dimple 4 mm deep next to mine and I looked one morning and it had disappeared, the whole back of my leg was a massive bruise 1 week and it was gone, Knee swelling and getting warm: 6 weeks on and still happening but looks almost normal first thing in the morning, If it doesn't swell you are most probably not pushing yourself enough. Finally my surgeon said the TKR is the most brutal routine operation that he performs so expect pain, don't rush it and never loose heart.

"Hi Paul
i just read your post and what a good description of a TKR you've given
I'm in the UKI and it definitely the same all over the world.
your Surgeon saying it is a brutal operation is so right I watched the video on You Tube and I'm glad I didn't watch it before my Op.
I'm now 14 weeks post op and have the added complication of a trapped sciatic nerve
night times are the worst with very little sleep
although I didn't have staples to close the wound I had a long continuous stitch which dissolved.
my scar now is so neat and a thin white line apart from one small red bit.
i think it's just a matter of getting the right medication / plenty of rest / exercise/ and ice.
take care and good luck

They are happy with the bend. I have been quite ""down"" about all this. I wonder how long all this will take and when will I be pain free. Does anyone know?

"Hi Tracy, sorry you aren't doing too well. Xx. I am four weeks down the line and know how you feel. Don't worry about 90 degree bend it's too early. I haven't got that now! I found those first weeks pain relief was a big problem too. My surgeon put me on oxycodone (I couldn't take tramadol because of feeling sick) and also paracetamol 1000mg every four hours. Until your stitches come out it is very difficult to get a bend in the leg, but don't worry it will come. We have all been there so you will get sympathy and support on here. The sleeping is a big problem. For the first time I slept 6 hours last night, taking Nytol (don't know the equivalent in Australia) which seems to work. I also suffer with sciatica and can't get comfortable in my bed. I now sleep on the sofa as I find the confined space helpful and can sleep on my back. My husband also gets a nights sleep as well now lol. Don't worry, it will get better believe me. Xxxxxxx

Pain all the time and just can't get comfortable. I think it's because the knee gets stiff when laying down. Pain in the back of knee still takes me by surprise. Can't believe this is all taking so long. Make sure you straighten your leg and do the knee clenching exercises to ensure you get good extension. My bend is good but the swelling is still 1 1/2 inches bigger than the other. Thank goodness my other knee is ok. Wishing you a good recovery.

"I have been feeling so down, because I am a very independent 75year old. Now I have to rely on my husband and although he is very good to me, he comes home telling me how it is with people he has spoken to who are getting on so well. 2weeks on I'm still feeling very tired, (nights are horrendous). No one told me how difficult sleep would be. Also I didn't expect to be taking so many pain killers. The hospital gave me enough for a week. I am so thankful that I found this discussion and I have read out some of your accounts of pain after ops to my husband. It is so good to realise I am not on my own.

"Hello Mag
i think that we would all agree that nothing prepares you for the brutal nature of this op. Even our surgeons have not actually gone through it and everyone on this forum says the same. It is a long process and we all have different recoveries but the intense pain and sleepless nights are a constant

"Oh dear mag we all know exactly how you feel. I also felt guilty about my husband doing everything but you have to just go with it at the moment. You are not able to do things for yourself and haven't hot the energy. The majority of us didn't do well I can assure you. The sleep is the main thing and the pain. I am still taking painkillers 8 weeks on. I think at 6 weeks things seemed to turn around, but that might have been just for me. It might happen for you a lot quicker. We all need the time to heal. I myself rested a lot, doing exercises when I felt able to do them. I didn't, like some people, exercise all the time. I myself thought it mor important to let my body do the talking. The nights were awful for me too, sleeping on the couch as I couldn't get comfortable in bed. I took NYtol for a while which seemed to help. Those first four weeks it is very hard to slerp eat snd exercise. You get plenty of rest Mags, let peopl wait on you and don't get down when you hear about others doing so well. Believe me things will get better for you. Everything seems to come together within a few days when you are ready. Keep us posted eith how you are feeling as we all will be able to sympathise and help you. Xxx

"I am an athletic 57-year-old male. I am five days postop left left TKR. I hit the wall the second day postop while in the hospital. The pain was just brutal! Since then it is steadily improving. I have one of the new Conformis iTotal knees. I have read there were some problems with some of the earlier ones which they have corrected. My surgeon did a minimally invasive procedure where the scar goes around the kneecap not across the top. The incision is about 5 inches long.
was operated on Monday released Wednesday and by Thursday was fully weight-bearing and gently walking on it without crutches. Friday I was going up and down stairs without crutches, one step at a time using my good leg. By the end of Friday I was finally able to do a couple of leg lifts without ant assist. Right now the most pain I get is from going flat to putting my legs down on the floor. It feels like battery acid is pouring into my veins. It takes about 3 minutes to slowly stand before I get over the pain. I max d out the CPM machine to 120 degrees on my 4th day post op. My extension is in the negative numbers (on the machine) but I really need to increase that as pre op I could not fully extend it. My knee is very rounded with inflammation so is difficult to bend on my own beyond 110 degrees. Starting last night I was able to roll over in bed without wincing in a lot of pain so my sleeping improved. A previous surgeon suggested I had an extremely high tolerance to pain as I had been bone on bone for the past 13 years yet still aggressively downhill skied on it. At the time I was 43 and he said I was a perfect candidate for a TKR replacement except for two problems, I was too young and I was too athletic. Fast forward 15 years and I started having issues with the knee again. Current surgeon looked at the new X-rays and read old report and said there's no reason any longer to wait. I went to the gym worked out hard with all the grinding going on and then just had surgery.

"My original response went to moderation because I included a web site link, so following is a copy without the direct link in case the original gets bounced.
Not sure if I should post that on a public forum. I think the best idea would be to go to conformis website and read everything on the site and watch all of the videos. My surgeon is one of the guys in one of the videos. I've always have been a cutting edge (no pun intended!!!) kind of guy so have no problem going with newer technology. The only thing is, I figure it is like any new technology, you never want the first generation. They are now on the second generation with some additional modifications added to it as some original issues had surfaced and haze been addressed. My surgeon is booked out 6 months in advance, does 5 TKR in a day and does it 2x a week that I am aware of. He also has people flying into New England from as far away as California that I am aware of. All I can say from what I'm reading, is recovery time for many seems to be way longer than what I am tracking for. I also know that I am putting in a lot of effort and pain to do it, but for now it is my full time job.

I am currently on morphine and Vicodin plus a blood thinner. Every day the swelling gets a little bit less, the pain a little bit less and my strength improves a little bit more. Only time will tell whether or not this new knee is as good as it seems and whether or not it would last as long as traditional knee replacements. Other than the ride home from the hospital I have been on my own preparing my own meals since coming home. I do have a freezer full of frozen food ready to go I wish you all the best hope you all keep improving.

"just in case people are upset that they are not recovering as fast you have to remember that recovery is in the shape of the bell curve. Some will do better some of the worse and some will do average. I may been lucky that every step along the way my bell curve am hitting the upper end of it so everything is speeded up. I may of been doing just as well with a different knee implant, different surgeon, different surgical procedure into the knee, or different knee arthritic pattern. There are just so many variables that what is good for one person may not be so good for the next person. I'm just posting how my surgery went and what the results are for me. Not everyone will or can respond in the same fashion that I have. I'm also not out of the woods yet either as I don't know how it will continue to perform in the coming weeks months years.

"The ebb and flow of pain.
6 Days Poat Op
Strange how pain comes and goes with a TKR.
I've been doing pretty good with motion and strength and all of the little successes each day. Pain has still been an issue as we all know.
Last night I hit the wall again and could not get comfortable.
I had taken the 2nd to last morpheme tablet an 1 hydrocodone last night before bed. I also applied ice while lying in bed. 4 hours later after tossing and turning in pain I got up and took 2 hydrocodone tablets and instead of ice I turned on the heating blanket. I know ice is good for swelling, but heat is good for relaxing muscles and soft tissues. That did the trick for another 4 hours when I woke again. Did the same thing again but climbed back into bed with an ice pack for 15 minutes then removed that and let the heating blanket do its thing. Seems to have worked. No additional swelling but the soft tissues and muscles seem quite a bit happier.

"Hi Don...it's strange but all the people who I talked to before the TKR never mentioned the night pain. In my case I think having fine weather post OP has helped. It meant I could have my knee outside of the quilt. I've found, with my knee, that even the weight of a sheet was too much. In fact any material, including lightweight cotton PJs, touching the skin over the scar seemed to produce a static charge type of pain. I've found, in my case. Standing a chair cushion, wrapped in a pillow case. Upright between my legs while lying on my back. Created a tent space over my knee giving me much relief. Only waking if the 'tent' colapsed onto the knee.

"7 days post op. 57 yres old.
The PT just left. Did not measure flexion but appears to be 0º or better.
Flexion has gone up to 115º.
Heat from underneath seems to help the soft tissue pain.
The terrible burning sensation from standing up appears to be gone.
Swelling is noticebly better.
Pain seems to be a constant 3 up to 6 or more at times.
Finished last morphene pill and only on Hydrocodone.
Originally had bouts of naseua but since taking medication with milk instead of ""food"" seems to really have helped.
Wish there was no pain but other than that extremely happy with results.

"Now about 6 months post op.
First thing I have to correct was I said I was 57, that was wrong, I was 58 and had a birthday between then and now so I am now 59. I'll chalk the discrepancy up to the good meds!
Now to catch up on my past history!
Pain was a killer until after 4 weeks when it finally started to subisde and basically got better every week. Every once in awhile I'd wake up to less pain.
I saw an in home PT for the first two weeks after the OP. By week 4 I could go without the heavy pain meds other than at night and used a combination of Ibuprofen and acetaminophen during the day so I could drive to the external PT. Saw him once one week than he scheduled me for 2 weeks later, and then 3 weeks after that! At the last appointment he said I was done with PT!!!??? I said I had my 2nd Dr's appointment in 6 weeks and asked if he thought I'd be ready, his reply was that I was already ready! I was already at 0º and 135º. PT said he wished all his patients did as well as me!
I must say that I've been in the gym since the 4th week post op and I'm sure this has been the most important thing in my recovery.
Saw my surgeon at my 3 month appointment. He said my next appointment would be in a year, but asked that I text him to tell him how my knee did my first day back snow skiing! He also stated that my replacement knee would end up being my stronger knee because of the arthritis in my natural knee and that one would probably need to be replaced in 10 years.
4 months out I fell down a 1/2 flight of stairs and crunched by new knee and sprained my opposite foot. Luckily the knee was technically fine but did hurt and between the foot and the knee it set me back about 4 weeks.
After 4 weeks recovery I did a fairly strenuous 1 mile hike up and back a mountainous trail, but kept it to a mile because my surgeon said to hold back on my first hike. The knee felt great, but my leg muscles were still and my aerobic fitness were the weak links!
3 days later I hiked the same trail, but this time to the summit. It is a 3.3 mile round trip with 1500 vertical foot climb, some of it up fairly large boulder steps. I ended up doing the same hike 3x in the same week! I must say the surgeon was right, my natural knee hurt whereas the TKR knee was fine!
It is really crazy how I am still learning to trust my TKR in places where I previously would of had to switch feet to protect that knee from pain for the past 30 years! What a relief!!!! An example is walking down a slope. Previously because of an ACL reconstrucion that got stretched, walking down a steep slope was impossible unless I went down sideways, now I can walk straight down it without any pain!
I know we're not suppose to run on it but I tried it out in 100 step units during a 3 mile walk to get my heart rate up. I had a GPS in my pocket and during one of the sections where I pushed it I hit 8.7 mph! Needless to say I probably won't be doing it again, but it was a great feeling to be able to run after 30 years of not being able!
This past week I hiked a 6 mile trail with 2000 vertical feet. The knee never hurt at all but my natural knee and the sprained foot did! Looks like I ended up with a case of plantars fasciitis from spraining my foot back 2 months ago , but the new knee never blinked!
Finally, even after 6 months things are still improving. It use to hurt to fully flex my knee, but some time after 5 months even that pain is almost completely gone, and my flexion is probably maxed out now at the mechanical limit of the new joint at somewhere around 140º!
Needless to say I am ecstatic with my new knee! It was very painful for the first 4 weeks with very little sleep. I worked out a lot getting stronger going into the surgery which both the PT and surgeon said helped a lot with my recovery. I also listened to my body after the surgery and did not do anything to agreviate it beyond what I felt comfortable with until the knee felt ready for it.
I just wanted to post this for everyone going through a tough time that there is light at the end of the tunnel and it will just keep getting better and better as you go along, it will just take time. Best of luck to you all!

I had my replacement 4 weeks ago and like you sleep is a nightmare. I think every time I move the leg it wakes me and then I am an hour or so before I get back to sleep.
my physio told me to massage my scar line as I too find this seems to be getting tighter and inhibiting movement. It has really helped. I massage the scar every hour with Diprobase ointment and at night I have just started putting lots of cream on and then covering with knee support bandage. It has helped a little. Good luck with your progress, it is. A slow job!!!

"To everyone one who is struggling with post op pain following a knee replacement, maybe I can help. Today is postop day 11 and I have been to hell and back. By day three at home, I couldn't move, let alone exercise, because of the severity of the pain. Ice packs were helpful for the swelling and I was taking far more than the prescribed dose of pain killers to no avail. The solution? A heated wheat bag! Relief was instant. It's important not to have it too hot, so wrap it in a clean t towel before placing over the wound. I also sleep with a pillow under my back and shoulders, with my head resting on two pillows behind. I also sleep with a pillow lengthwise under my knee. This has allowed me to sleep comfortably on my back. The heat bag had been my saviour, may it be yours.

"Yeh, I was told to continue my pain meds for 2-3 days and the suggestion was it would start to get better after that... do they actually talk to their previous patients at all? It's definitely worse day 5 post op than it was day 3, plus my wound dressing is insanely itchy!!
I'm a bit dubious about adding more heat though, seems plenty hot enough on its own - I love my ice pack, that's what's keeping me sane.

"Oh, YES! I had that same problem with my left knee total knee replacement this past June! When therapy came to work with me in the hospital the day after surgery I was unable to lift my leg, unable to move it side to side and felt NUMB from the nerve block for WEEKS after surgery!
Swelling has a lot to do with success of movement. Be sure your husband ices his knee top and bottom frequently throughout the day. This helps. Also, sitting back in a hard chair with arms provides better support as he is trying to effect good movement.
He is still in the very early stages at just one week post op. At that stage my left knee felt like a 1000 pound TREE TRUNK!
I used my husband's belt looped around my foot to move my leg up and down, from side to side getting into bed, and getting it over the side of the tub while sitting on my shower stool. My physical therapist suggested this. I later discovered that she had had BOTH KNEES replaced four years ago when she was just 42. She moves so well know and you would never guess she had both knees replaced just a short time ago!
It will come! Encourage him to be patient! Please update us from time to time on his progress!

I had my second therapy session today in home but had one on day 2 in the hospital. I went home from the hospital with a 95 bend and am now 105. I can walk stairs with pain. I have found the pain pills taken before and after therapy and the ice are lifesavers. Swelling is way down since yesterday. I am walking well with the walker. Cannot sleep because of the pain behind the knee but I doze off and nap in the recliner. Next knee replacement will take place in a little less than 4 weeks. Hope it goes well and the first is better by then.

"Hi,
i had bilateral knee replacements 3 weeks ago. I regretted having them done in the first week. I was in so much pain and didn't have a ""good"" leg to stand on. Physio got me up the day after my op and I used a walker where my elbows slotted into arm rests and sort of leaned into it to walk. I thought I would die. After 3 days, I walked on the aid to the gym and came back 45 minutes later on a walking stick. I cut out the use of crutches all together. I was amazed at my own determination. I used the stick for about 2 days and have been walking without any aid since.
id like to say I'm pain free now but of course, that's not the case. One knee as improved quicker than the other but they are both stiff and ache. Stairs are by far the worst. I was taken out for lunch today by my family. It was my first outing. I found sitting down on a normal height chair difficult and also, when I went to the bathroom the toilet seemed so far down. Id hired chairs for home. The walk around felt good but very slow.
just wanted to say, everyone is different and recovery time is a long time. I can say I'm glad I had the operation and feel confident my new knees will be good for me. I have my first outing on a public bus this week and hoping I'll fair well. I think we all shouldn't be so hard on ourselves and We should marvel on the fact that we're able to have this operation.
i wish you all a speedy recovery but what will be, will be.

"Hi Sue!
So good to hear that you have been able to come so far in just three weeks following BOTH KNEES being replaced at the same time! My neighbor was several MONTHS at rehab before she reached where you are now!
I am three weeks post op with my right knee. Eighteen weeks ago I had my left knee done. Both individually were plenty challenging for me even though I was fortunate to suffer no complications. I think you and others who have had both knees done at the same time are INCREDIBLY BRAVE!
I, too, am grateful that my surgery is completed and that I was a candidate FOR surgery. My X-RAYS prior to surgery were just pitiful. I knew surgery truly was my only option if I was to be able to live the rest of my life in a way that I wanted to live it.
Many people aren't so fortunate. My mother-in-law was told by several surgeons that she NEEDED hips and knees replaced (severe RA) but that she was not in good enough health to survive any operation. She accepted the opinions but wished she had had options. She is now in a nursing home and unable to walk. I sure do wish we could run the clock back and get her into surgery a few decades ago!
Congratulations on your determination! You will succeed with whatever you do, I can just tell! Good attitude with a lot of persistence goes a long way to create successful outcomes. Thank you for inspiring us all to hang in there!

"Hi Sue, I was advised by my Surgeon to not have both done at the same time. I had my left tkr done 10 days ago and have done very well. I am walking unaided. I left the hospital the day after surgery and negan home therapy 3 times a week. Today I walked 1/10 of a mile. Minimal pain, and minimal swelling. My Surgeon did not cut any muscle but moved it to the side. From what I am reading on this forum, I am glad he does this procedure. I have an appointment in 4 days to get my stitches out. I will continue therapy until I have the right done in 3 weeks. I hope that my right knee responds as my left has. Everyone does have different Rehab results. My tips are follow your PT exercises, ice as much as you can stand, keep up with pain management, and rest. Pray that you all have quick recoveries.

"Hi,
I am at 7 1/2 weeks and I can tell you that sleeping was a bitch.
It was validating to hear from others on this site in knowing that this is a very common complaint. I could not get comfortable because I could not lie on either side......only on my back which would start to hurt after awhile. They if I was really out and my body managed to slip to a side my knee would immediately let me know with blinding pain.
What I can tell you is that I started seeing a major shift at around 4 weeks with progress in the recovery. Was it huge? No but noticible enough to allow me to move forward knowing there was light at the end of the tunnel. You are still super early in your recovery.
I have a friend that has an upcoming surgery for the same thing so I was like the guinea pig by going first. I wrote a spreadsheet for her of all the things to do pre op and post op that no one tells you about so that she could be fully prepared.
I noticed that you are using a bag of ice. I tried that number for several weeks and it was an incredible pain notably because I was pretty much taking care of myself. I HIGHLY recommend going through Amazon and purchasing a CryoCuff for your knee for icing and compression. It is very portable and I have even taken it in the car with me. The ice lasts for a good 6+ hrs and it is the size of a gallon picnic thermos. Check it out.
Promise it will get better. We all did this for the ulitmate outcome and that is to get back to healthy living and you will

"Hello Ann, I am right in line with you as far as the time span of surgery. I had mine on April 18th. My knee is as swollen (and a little red) as the day it was first done. The pain comes and goes but really hurts during PT or if they want me to stretch it out strait and keep it like that so it will loosen the back part of the muscles. I guess anti iflammitories would help but I can't take them because of my stomach. But I do have the problem with sleeping under control. I try to elevate my leg and get it as comfortable as my body will allow it and take my sleeping pill. It's not foolproof because sometimes I wake in strange painful positions. But I just wanted to let you know I am right here if you want to share things that are going on with you too. So take care and good luck. Also, I will be taking advice from the people here because I'm sure they have good info.

I'm amazed that I haven't seen anyone that went home with a continuous movement machine. I don't know what I would have done without it. It moves the leg bending the knee all through the night which makes sleeping possible and the pain bearable.
Ask you doctor about getting one for you. My insurance covered the cost and I'm in the U.S. with terrible Obamacare, but that was covered.

Walking gently, without crutches, is the one way to relieve pain. Feel as if I only had total of six hours sleep since the 72 hours.

The pain associated with TKR has been a shock to me as everyone that has had this surgery either forgot the pain or out and out lied! The only surgery that was more painful was plastic surgery to repair where they cut away my abdominal area due to MRSA infection. Pain does subside especially if you have therapy. The more you stretch the knee the less pain you'll have. Keep up the great work but, if you even think you have an infection DO NOT WAIT. GO TO EMERGENCY. Infections can kill you!

"Not sure if you can get your doctor to order a continuous motion machine for you or not, but if he will, you WILL sleep at night. The constant movement keeps the knee from swelling up during the night and sleep makes your recovery quicker. I also recommend an ice machine which has a wrap that alliws a constant COLD air around the knee during waking hours. This also aids in healing. I'm now almost 7 weeks post op and my knee feels like I never had surgery. Therapy is a MUST. At least twice a week and do your exercises 3 times a day!
You'll soon be saying, it was nothing!! HA HA HA

"Hi!
I ran into a similar situation but in the opposite order. My first (Left Knee) had TERRIBLE SWELLING and felt so heavy that I thought they just MIGHT have put in a prosthesis made of IRON!??
My second surgery (Right Knee) three and a half months later went so effortlessly that I could move my right leg all around even in the recovery room and was discharged after just two days.
Two knees.
Same body.
Same surgeon.
Same hospital.
VERY confusing stuff!
I am doing fine now one year and nine months respectively from the two surgeries.
We take our chances with each surgery, but in the end each surgery is different even though they are on our same body.
Try wearing compression hose on both legs ( thigh high). Try laying on your bed with both legs stretched up the headboard of your bed. (Use a looped belt to help elevate them to the position.) If you can, try Ibuprofen. It does an AWESOME job in my opinion of lessening swelling.
The Oxycodone and Hydrocodone I took with Knee #1 and then Knee#2 didn't help me nearly as well as plain old WONDERFUL Ibuprophen! You may find it to be true as well.
Are the bumps on your incision itchy?
Do you have a fever?
Check with your doctor if your answers to these are ""Yes"".
Please let us know how things go!

"Have you used a different lotion or soap?
After using Neosporin for years, I developed an itchy rash using it on my arm one day. Our son had a similar reaction. I figured they MAY have changed something in the medication.
Rashes and itching are SO annoying! Try using Ivory soap for awhile. Our school nurse suggested that to me, and it helped. It also does an excellent job on poison ivy, too!

"Hi Ann
I assume things are better now 1 yr out. I'm 3 weeks post tkr and still reliant on 10 mg oxy plus 2 extra strength Tylenol 3x a day. Like everyone else, nights are a killer. Without medicating 1 hr prior to bed, it's a toss and turn game. I'm young, 55, and fit but this surgery knocked me on my butt in terms of pain and general sense of well being. How long till the swelling and stiffness abates?

"There is some very good advice on this thread but there is one very clear conclusion which should be heeded.
1. Each one of us is completely different
2. Different things work for some but not for others
3. Most people are not giving their age and what the reason was for their op and what their range of movement etc was before.
All of this is critical really. It would appear that some are relatively young and had the op because of pain to others who were older and effectively crippled with twisted distorted legs (me!). The expectations will probably be different in each case.
Good luck with your knees and best wishes,
Dave

"I had my TKA 31 days ago. The first 10 days were hell. I was only in the hospital for 1 night and started formal PT two days later. I just finished my 13th session (3 days a week) and am able to bend to 118 degrees. The swelling is what my biggest impediment is. It swells all the way to my foot. What I have found helpful is to use the ace wrap. I tried not doing that today and am paying dearly for it.
As mentioned, keep doing the exercises. It is so important to get the muscle strength back. I can do 12 inch up steps, balance on uneven surface and sqaut to almost a sitting position. I have never taken a day off.
Agreed that sleeping is a major challenge. I can't go more than a couple hours without waking.

"Yes, it DOES get better!😊
The body has been through A LOT. Healing takes awhile because there is a great deal cut and moved and glued and sewn and traumatized during surgery.
When your quad muscles strengthen, the leg WILL lift. At first I was proud of myself when I could move my TOES.
Swelling is very common, and ice doesn't always help lessen it unfortunately. Try thigh-high compression stockings and elevating your leg (use a looped belt over your foot to help lift the leg) higher than your heart.
Stiffness is common, too. Anytime I sit too long or even lay in one position in bed, I am stiff. Rainy and snowy days bring ADDED stiffness as well. Try stretching in bed before you ever get out of bed. Stretch before getting up out of a chair or out of a car. It really is time well spent and provides more stability and better balance once you ARE up, as well.
You are still very early in the game. Focus on small improvements rather than ""SHOULD"" be able to --------. Be patient with yourself , and get as much rest as you can. Rest HEALS, and rest provides a more positive outlook!
You can DO this!
Yes you can!🙌😊😁🙌

"Would LOVE hearing how you are doing as you progress through the healing process!😊
You MAY notice the old ""three steps forward and two steps back"" method of progress. I know I did. No matter. Just keep believing in yourself! 🙌😊😁🙌 Keep as positive as you can. Positive feelings create endorphins which actually help with any pain you may have. LAUGH at every chance you can. I watched funny movies like ""Animal House"" with John Belushi and the ""National Lampoon Vacation"" movies with Chevy Chase to get me refocused on laughing and NOT worry or feelings of ""poor me"".
I don't know if you are a believer, but if you are, PRAYER certainly helps and is my main method for remaining calm during this whole process of healing and getting back to feeling good again.
Gentle squats while holding onto the kitchen counter are VERY GOOD thigh strengtheners. I continue to do them even now, a year after my surgeries, to keep my thigh muscles strong.
Come here often. You will learn so much! I know I did early on, and I am STILL getting tips from those who are further along in the process. For me this site provided me with friends around the world who KNEW what I was going through and truly could sympathize as well as provide ideas to try. That has been priceless!💟
Have a great day!

"Hi I have the same. I'm 10 days post op. It's a deep nagging ache all along the outside of my leg from ankle to groin. It keeps me awake at night. I get very sore pain on the inside of my knee and other various pains from sharp stabbing ones to what feels like something stinging. It also aches behind my knee a lot. I'm icing my knee regularly and trying to do the exercises, but no way can I raise my leg off the bed. I've been pottering about on crutches and going up and down stairs ok. I even managed a very quick shower the past two days, but it's quite unnerving with nothing to hold on to! I'm on my own in the day time as my husband is at work, so I have to be independent.
I keep thinking I'm not making enough progress so this forum is helping me to realise I'm not alone.and reassures me that I'm doing OK for this early in the recovery process. Good luck with your recovery.

"My knee surgery was 14 days ago. I had stayed in the hospital 2 nights. I was not ready to go home after my first night do to my pain med was not working. Once they found what meds I need to go home with . The next day I went home. My pain was mostly in the whole leg. I felt the pain mostly on the back side. I took my pain med every 4 hr and iced the swelling constantly. I could only sleep on my recliner with my leg up on a pillow. My pain was always worst after therapy. It like they had me do things with that knee that I was not prepared for. The therapy had started 3 days after the operation. I do some exercises at home to stench the knee. I still have pain in my leg and not taking my meds as often. I had started walking with a Cain after nine days of the surgery date. The leg is stiff and takes a while to loosen it up. I can not sit in a chair for any length of time. I believe this pain will slowly subside in do time . Every body different into how the healing process goes. I was told that every day gets better.

"Still early mate, dont push it. Found ice packs hurt more than did good. Found the best was in the evening during your shower i let the hot water run on my knee till it was real hot. After you get out the shower sit on your bed with feet on the floor and knee bent as much as you can. Keep your feet flat on the floor and move your body forward till your knee cant take the pain anylonger. Hold it there and you will get used to the pain. Hold it like that for as long as possible and rub your knee with something like voltaren. Worked for me. Was bending my knee to 180 after 8 weeks.

"Hi Ann
Please ring the ward you was on or your Dr's surgery for info about meds.
Recovery after TKR can take between 6 months to 2 years.
I'm due to have mine revised in a couple of months.
Keep your leg up as much as possible, with icing, take pain killing meds every 4 hrs.
Its important to do the exercises the physio told you.
Sleep deprivation is a major downside of recovery. Sometimes your Dr may prescribe something to help you sleep or you could try Kalms herbal tablets.
Hope this helps you and anybody else in pain.

I had a total knee replacement 6 months ago. I fell off a ladder into a laminate floor 7 years ago which caused one knee to deteriorate. I'm only 57. I was driving a 4 x 4 and returned to office work after 2.5 weeks. I'm self employed so had little choice. I was on one crutch after one week. However 6 months later I still have pain, limp a lot when I first move then it eases off but there's still a limp. I used to wear 4 inch heels but obviously can't now. Wearing Sketchers is easier but I have to wear heels for work so I can manage 1.5 inch ok for now. I'm hoping that in another 6 months I'm fully recovered. My knee will bend to 95° only but I'm way off straightening it. I'm getting private sports remedial massage to help but progress us slow. I can walk my dogs for 1.5 miles but only with resting on benches. I'm very disappointed but I live in hope it will recover.
I did sleep ok in early days because I took strong painkillers. I came off those the second month end. Now on nothing.
I do hope I can get my proper life back the way it used to be before the ladder fall.

"I had my 2nd tkr (left) two weeks ago today. My right leg tkr surgery was 11 months ago. it is wonderful! This time around is a little different more pain and swelling. I know how much better it will be so I work thru the pain. Both surgeries were outpatient. Had nerve block which controlled pain for first 48 hrs. 1000mg Tylenol and 800mg Advil taken at the same time every 8 hours -oxy when needed. Stopped oxy after 4 days. Staples pinched when removed but relief after! I start outpatient therapy today. I can bend to 90 and straighten -5. My confidence is getting better, my mind tells me to limp but I don't have too. Elevate, ice and move around every hour. Stay positive it only gets better!

"I know your pain. I had finger bruises on my thighs. I think they have to hold the leg /ankle so hard to get the replacement on but it should heal. This certainly wasn't the journey that I expected but I am told that it does get better. I never went to rehab because I heard such terrible things and I had been in pain for so many years that I thought I might just punch someone if they inflicted pain on me so I chose do do it myself. My Dr. Told me that if I did my 2 exercises I would be good. I really worked at It, in my time and I have pretty good range of motion. I used a Jacuzzi to help bend my knee, with good results. I am 3 months out from a double knee replacement and I am not pain free by any means. For me, I did what I could and my Rom came back. I have lots of swelling and pain. I also have a clicking sound when I walk. Bummer. Don't despair. Rest and elevate and listening ur own body. Everyone recovers differently. Take this time to just rest ur body. I believe it just takes time.

"I had my surgery two years ago tomorrow! Other than the first 4 weeks of what I would call agony, the knee is great. I had 5º to 105º before the surgery. From the beginning I had great flexibility. Within a week I had improved to 0º and 120º and now somewhere over 140º! Other than the home PT for the first 2 weeks, I saw my PT a total of 3 times! I asked why and he said I had already met all expected goals so there was no need for any PT. At my 6 week post op meeting with my surgeon, he said see you next year, but the only thing he wanted to know was how my knee did back my first day skiing!
This past season was my first time back. I skied 6 days in a row without ANY pain whatsoever. As a matter of fact my real knee hurt and was slightly swollen, but my new knee was never stiff or swollen in anyway shape or form! While skiing I ended up thinking of my real knee more than my artificial one!!!
For anyone interested, I have the Conformis custom fit TKR.

"Hi Guys, i had my total knee replacement on the 16 May 2016 and im still in pain. I have been put in the 1 in 50 failed joint replacement and i am certain it was due to the pressure put on you to bend your knee as much as possible in the shortest period of time. If you have any sort of swelling after the op and abnormally high amount of pain go see you GP asap. I got a bad infection 3 weeks after surgery.The sleeping part is the pain in the butt part. What i found the best but dont recommend it is i took double the pain meds before i went to sleep and that would knock me out for a good part of the evening.
My recommendation to you is to as much as you feel comfortable with and no more putting in just a little more effort every day. In the evening i would have a shower just before bed time and heat my knee up with the hot water, i would then sit on the edge of my bed with your foot on the floor and your knee bent to its max then keeping your feet on the floor slowly move your body forward thus bending your knee to a greater angle till you cannot take the pain anylonger but you must hold it there for at least 5 min, i know its painful but you will find the pain will start to faid as you get used to that pain. I also went for physio every day which did help but you can get away with it by rubbing voltaren in yourself from thigh down to ankle and i mean a good rub. I was off all meds by 6 weeks but at 12 weeks i was walking and felt a hooking sensation with a loud crack and unbelievable pain and that was the start to the pain i live with day to day.
All i can say is dont force your knee to do what is not comfortable, do things at you own pace but you must bend it just a little more every day and if there is any abnormal swelling or pain see your GP asap. Your next big pain in the butt is still to come. The wife and i love traveling and man going through security points is such a pain nowadays and not even your doctors letter or the scar is going to stop them frisking you every time.
