"I wondered if anyone could help me, since about January 2013 I have on and off had a dull ache in my stomach, sometimes flaring up to make me feel sick. I actually put this down to anxiety however in the past few weeks my theory has changed.
About three weeks ago my stomach flared up however to the worst pain I have experienced as yet, made me feel like I was going to be sick constantly and made me not know what to do with myself. I feel like there is a lump in my thought and my stomach feels tender and swollen when flares up feels like my stomach is on fire/knotted up!
The pain was so sever I went to the doctors (2 and a half weeks ago), my doctor felt my stomach and said it felt swollen, I told her the symtoms and she says she thinks I have gastritis and prescribed me with Lansoprazole 30mg tablets to take daily for 1 month, this however to date hasn't helped my stomach at all, the flare up comes and goes however the pain in my stomach is constant and the Lansorprazole is causing terrible upset stomach to the point I am worried to not be near a toilet.
I went back to the doctors on Tuesday 22/10 explained all of the above to her and she said I am to keep taking the tablets and she is happy to see me again in November (once the months course has been taking) however im in dispear with this pain HAD ENOUGH OF FEELING ILL and can't help but think the worse
Has anyone experienced symptoms same as above as I feel extremely on my own shouting and no one understanding what im going though

"Sounds like you've got a raging H. pylori infection, you need antibiotics for this. (If it's really really raging / painful) a Gastroscopy (an endoscope down the Throat and into the Stomach) to get an idea of it's true extent would be very helpful. If you are of modest means then some Generic Soluble Paracetamol could hit the spot, if you are a bit more minted then I'd go for Soluble Solpadeine Max,, do not take Ibuprofen, Aspirin or Diclofenac (or any other NSAID), nor use any creams or gels containing these drugs...

"In that case then the Endoscopy is definitely the way to go. If you've been well in every other respect then I doubt it's anything 'serious', the worst it could be is a substantial Stomach Ulcer, they'll biopsy your Stomach when you have the Endoscopy (depending on how close they're taken from near the scabby bits the biopsies don't hurt)

"Ok so its been just over two weeks since my last post and this is whats been happening and where I am now...
I went to the doctors on Friday 25/10 and got referred to a private hospital THANKFULLY (finding the nhs doctors not very helpful at all if im honest). So Saturday 26/10 I went and saw a stomach specialist, he listened to all my symptoms and what I had been going through and how long, I also told him about the Lansoprazole which wasn't working at all (which he said if its not working, stop taking it which I did), he examined my stomach (felt it) and booked me in for an Ultrasound which was on Wednesday 30/10 and an Endsocopy on Wednesday 06/11, he didn't comment on what it could be as he said he needed to run these tests first. I asked him what I could do for the pain in the mean time, he said he didn't know as he didn't know what was wrong, which is a fair comment but to maybe try paracetmol and see if that helps.
So the pain in my stomach was still feeling horrendous, flaring up general mornings and afternoons to the point it would make me get extremely upset and not knowing what to do with myself, on Sunday 27/10 so much so I just said to my other half pls just look online and see what I can do to cope! I seriously didn't think I was going to make it to either of the coming appointments. I get upset stomach a couple of times a day too which added to the worry.
He looked online and said it sounds like I have an ulcer so basically said to me to eat every 2 hours (little and often), stop drinking tea (I only have 4 a day anyway) so I have exchanged it for 3 green teas a day, I used to have 1 can of sprite in the evening with my dinner which I have stopped as you shouldn't drink fizzy drinks, I have stopped eating spicy foods, I used to smoke 5 cigarettes a day which I have reduced by 1 so now smoke 4 a day and only have one after eating... Long story short it this seems to of stopped my stomach flaring into mega pain however the pain is still there but luckily it enabled me to go to work etc.
So I had the ultrasound, ALL CLEAR! which was a massive relief as I was petrified they was going to pick up something bad... he checked ALL my organs and said it all looks absolutely fine, which was a huge relief however they don't pick up stomach ulcers on an ultrasound so I still needed an endoscopy to see what was going on inside my stomach however the relief I had that the scan was all clear.
So it felt like a week took forever to roll round until the Endoscopy, Wednesday 6th November was finally here, which I was extremely nervous about as the thought of having a camera down my throat into my stomach which was sooooooo painful was terrifying, my apt was at 3.15 and I wasn't allowed to eat for 6 hours before hand.
I had the endoscopy under Sedation (which didn't fully work) however it didn't take them long to do it and the doctor and nurses were amazing and really put me at ease. To be honest I was just glad when it was all over, however my results were ALL CLEAR! No ulcer and from what he said my stomach all looked fine!
Well in a way it was lovely to hear however what is this pain I have been getting! So as you can imagine I am no further forward really, my stomach is still extremely tender I feel sick all of the time, I have a lump in my throat I am eating and drinking all the right things (as far as im concerned) I have had the all clear on all tests so far WHAT DO I DO ?
The consultant didn't have time to see me after the endoscopy, so now im booked in to see him on Monday 25/11 yes another two weeks away I am pinning so much on this apt, I can't surely live with this pain for the rest of my life, I don't want to go out or do anything its a struggle to come to work and I am just sick of not feeling well.
The one thing that I have changed in my life since xmas is I started taking Asda's own A-Z Vitamins and Minerals, could I per allergic maybe? I stopped taking these on Thursday 07/11 however to date haven't noticed a difference in how I feel, how long should I leave it for to see if it is them?
Other than that I just don't know

"I'm not sure what is going on with you, but a few years ago I had unexplained gastritis that the doctors did not take seriously. Everything I ate caused nausea than diarrhea. I was losing a lot of weight and since I am already naturally underweight, I didn't have much to spare. I finally was prescribed marinol, which helped with keeping food down, but if I didnt take it the symptoms returned.. I eventually completely modified my diet and did a yeast cleanse (no sugar (grains) and certain yeast friendly foods) for 2 weeks. Then I went on the Paleo diet. My symptoms disappeared.. I don’t know if this works for you.. but it sounds like you’ve tried a lot of the harder stuff already.

Thank you for writing, How long did your gastritis go on for in total? Luckily I haven't been sick as yet even though I feel on the edge of being sick all the time, however I do get a constant upset stomach.
The Paleo diet sounds interesting, have you stayed on that diet ever since?
I am finding that since I have been eating every two hours (little and often) it has helped, however I still get upset stomach in the mornings and every early evening, strange as its generally always the same sort of time and mixing up what I eat doesnt' seem to change that either.

"I stayed on the Paleo diet for 6 months. I had to stop because I got married, and my husband was not as supportive of my diet. It became too hard to continue it when the other person in the house continued questioning its effectiveness. I really believed that it helped though and always recommend it to anyone with stomach problems. When I stopped doing it, I was okay for about 4 months, then the symptoms started to come back.I struggle with gastritis occasionally now... So that would be 3 years now.. but of those three years I spent 18 months of it pregnant and 6 months of it on the diet. I did not have the symptoms when I was pregnant.
I agree, smaller meals should help. You are making it easier on your digestive system when you eat smaller meals.

My wife has twice had a similar problem to you. First time she was admitted to hospital and like you had all the tests. Nothing found t account for the pain. I suggested that she take Aloe Vera and after a few weeks it worked. When she had a follow up appointment the consultant was non committal about her remedy.
He had some students with him and he asked her to wait until they discussed her case. We could hear them through the partition. One said that her mother had gone through a similar episode and had been helped by Aloe Vera. She commented that her mother said that it is expensive but worth it.
Three years ago my wife had the same symptoms again and went through the same tests plus a CT scan. Again nothing was found. She has been taking Aloe Vera every day since. She has stopped it a few times when on holiday etc but has been glad to get back on to it so now takes capsules away with her.

"Hello Derek
Thank you for your message, always interested in hearing other people that have been/or going through a similar thing.
I will have to look into Aloe Vera Capsules, out of interest, what was your reasoning to suggest for her to take the Aloe Vera Capsules? I wonder what is in them that is helping her stomach?
Glad to hear that it is working for her!
Just to give an update on me, since last writing I received confirmation from my consultant that the Endoscopy results were all clear, I since had blood tests testing me for pretty much everything which came back all clear, toilet sample tests all clear, and a colonoscopy which 4 biopsy's were taken again ALL CLEAR! My consultant didn't want to put me in for a CT scan as he is confident with the tests that he has done (he said if it gets worse that would be next but to go away and see how I get on)
He recommended me to take ""Acidophilus Plus"" (good bacteria capsules from Holland and barrat) I have been taking these for 2 weeks now (2 a day) and since taking them have noticed a massive difference, I get the odd days of not feeling 100% however its not a daily occurance like it was and my stomach hasn't been flaring up like it was.
I have to be a little careful regarding spicy food still however I am trying to have it now and again just so my stomach gets used to it.
I will however look into Aloe Vera also as that sounds positive.

"Hello Tamika,
Sorry to here you are going through the same thing
Since last writing I feel like I am getting somewhere (well my stomach isn't a daily nightmare, at the moment anyway), as I said I am still taking the Acidophilus Plus capsules which I think are my savour! Since taking these it seems to of made a massive impact on my stomach, In 5 1/2 weeks I have just had 3 flare ups! which is amazing compared to having it daily for 3 1/2 MONTHS!
Last week (due to the flare ups I had again - which all happened in the same week) I decided to go to a nutritionist and have a food allergy test done. It didn't show that I had any sever food allergies however there was about 8 things that showed up that ""stressed"" my digestive system if eaten, so now I have changed my diet again so I only have those items in small amounts on occasion. I hope this is the cure!
Good luck with your results and getting to the bottom of what is causing your pains.

"Hello Jenny,
I am sorry to hear of your long term frustration and pain. It looks like you may be on the right path now. I am hoping you are doing better with your avoidance of certain foods.
I am curious to find out what food you are avoiding. I have had the EXACT same symptoms. 2 years ago, I went to my doctor, and she suggested that I may have an intolerance to gluten. She suggested I remove all gluten from my diet, and take probiotics. I did that, and felt so much better after 10 days. I still have flare-ups now and then, and have been wondering if I have an intolerance to other foods as well. So far, I think it may be nuts, egg yolks, brocolli, and aspartame. This week, I have had severe flare-ups, and have become very nervous in what I can eat. I am wondering if I also have an intolerance to dairy products.
I went to see my doctor (unfortunately not the same one that recommended going gluten-free) and she has ordered an ultrasound for tomorrow. She thinks it is my appendix. My 'gut' feeling is that she is wrong, and do not want to go through a bunch of tests.
What foods are you avoiding? I would just like to compare with what I am avoiding and see if I am missing anything.
Thanks for your input, hope you continue to have good results!

"Jenny,
in Nov of 2009 i had a Nissen fundoplication, its a surgery where they wrap the top of my esophagus with a mesh to keep stomach acids from splashing up and causing extreme pain. it reduced my pain dramatically for about 2 years, and in 2011 the pain came back, i was checked for another hernia, ulcers, h pylori, celiacs disease, and many others. all results came back negative. I began just to live with the pain as a part of day to day life. about 4 months ago it got so bad that i had completely stopped eating and if i did eat i became very sick and dizzy. i again went to the doctor had much of the same tests done and again no results that would indicate a reason why it hurts. I have quit smoking, drinking alcohol and soda pop, spicy foods are unfortunately no longer a part of my life, and i am now no longer able to bend over and pick things up as it causes stomach pain. reading through your messages it sounds very similar to where i am at as well. Aloe Vera seems to help somewhat, however there is one thing i have tried that assists with helping subdue the pain so that i can eat, and that is the ingestion of cannabis.
Now i no this is always a sensitive topic, and is still illegal in most states in the US to include the state that i live in. but there is some medical research done into the effects of cannabis on stomach pain such as what i have and seemingly what you have as well. ""smoking"" of it DOES NOT HELP ME, in fact it almost makes it worse at times, however my mother lives in a state where it is legal to use for medical purposes, and i have been ingesting it for roughly a month and have been able to eat and maintain my lifestyle. I thought that i would share this with you as it seems like you have exhausted many resources and although its not the most ""professional and desirable"" way of treating this, it is working for me. I Hope that this helps you out.
Please research this for your self as well. do not just take my word on it. and do not buy off the street as that may have other things laced in it and you do not know the history of how it was grown which causes a risk of doing more harm then help.

"BY Taking Cannabis in any form is a mistake! thats the same as TAKING OTHER DANGEROUS PRESCRIPTION PAIN MEDICATIONS! If you wish to COVER UP THE REAL PROBLEM!!! And GET WORSE THEN TAKING CANNABIS and other pain medications would be the route to go!!! But you will be the reason why you get worse!. Competent medical professionals know that prescribing any kind of pain reducer hides the real symtoms of the medical condition and can cause a much later or too late diagnosis. Thus further damaging or in many cases killing the patient! You have to have the common sense to understand this simple fact.

"Very good idea also, I just recently received my medicinal marijuana card back in April 2014.my girlfriend said that there's capsules for gastro problems. And she wants to get them and have her mom try themso of course the s bother thingsame idea popped into my head also.today being the third daythat I'm in so much pain I'm ready to go back to the ER like I did years ago when I found out my diagnosis as really bad acute gastritis.acute does not mean small and the doctor termination for acute is even worse, so last 3 days I've been really worried, because of an issue few times already w cervical cancer,something my doctors cannot diagnose my Rheumatologist just keeps running more blood tests stating the same thing over and over again and telling me smoke weed he said in front of my father and I,I laughed and joked he kidded around,stating I not the doctor they can give you that prescription, but you can go get that! So I did,I haven't had the chance to try the capsules from the store yet.but being that my daily life consists of many medications including morphineand the pain is still as horrible as it ismy educated guess would be something very wrongbut yet every time I go to an ERthey don't seem to do anything for melooks like it's off to YET ANOTHER specialist! Oh not to mention but my father found an article on the procedure I had time after I had my 3 boys called Essure,which I find out the Erin Brockovich THE Erin Brockovich,had a class action lawsuit she was trying to pursue and currently isI think I'm number 200 something on that list of hers because once I watched her YouTube video on how sick these other women were getting, it seem like it all started to come together.I'm now using Meddi Hash, morphine, norco (which contains a lot of Tylenol I don't like taking especially being diabetic), soma a muscle relaxer for my muscle spasms through my back & neck and all through my body I have procedures done every 6 months on my back and now they just ran four procedures on my neck from c3 through 7 I do not want to put cages in my back or a rod through my whole spine,I still have a six year old Son getting ready to turn 7,and my 9 year old and my 12 year old.I would like to still be able to throw a football with them when thier 13 or
15.although I don't see that happening considering my shoulder is dilapidated,/ing now effecting my elbow! It just hurts so bad knowing that I spent years for 8 hours a day to train my body to do things normal people cant do, to get hit by a car,find out I have degenerative disc disease among MANY OTHER THINGS.I Also had Kawasaki disease as a child and because it's such a rare disease I figured maybe they should have followed me my whole life to see how it effects you 30 years later.I wish much luck to all of youmany prayers and much love God bless Sincerely

I am from the United states and like you have been experiencing the same exact thing as you. Spent alot of time in and out of doctors and emergency rooms only to find out that nobody knows what was wrong with me. I finally found a doctor in my town who is also a younger one and he told me it was caused by anxiety. He ended up putting me on an anti depressant which eventually stopped the pain I was having and he also gave me this blue pill called dicyclomine which stopped the pains dead in their tracks. I have eventually gone off the anti depressant because I don't like taking drugs and I have been off of them for 2 months now and within the last week here I have been having excruciating pains in my belly. I will be making an appointment coming up here so I can have these pains taken care of. Hope this helps you and anyone else suffering from this.

"It's amazing that stomachs can behave like this with no known cause. It's my story, too, so my heart goes out to those who suffer with like issues. I've had gobs of tests, endoscopies, CTs, blood tests, etc etc. My doctor cannot tell me why my stomach hurts at the very top, sometimes burns, sometimes a dull ache. This time it has been ongoing, not constant (comes and goes) for 16 months. More frequent and small meals help. I do have a reflux problem and IBS. I have been taking Nexium for years but try to take it only 3 times a week instead of every day. I also use Kefir at least several times a week. Still, I wish I knew what causes this. One of my docs told me a lot of people have this problem and no cause is discovered. Frustrating at best.

"I am at my wits end as well, such a mystery and I wish I could find some answers. With me, my pain comes in cycles/flares, I can have a constant pain which is achey/twinges in the upper central abdomen, about 2 inches above my belly button. My pain will last anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, then magically disappears, this is why I call it flares. Have had all the tests a few years back. Ultrasound, endoscopy, colonoscopy, tested for celiac etc... My pain is constant, it does very in intensity through the day, but it's always there, smack dab in the middle of my upper abdomen. Nothing I eat makes it worse or better, bowels are soft than hard, so i was told it's ibs. But why would ibs come and go like this? I can sometimes go months and be fine, but when it does happen, I have it for weeks/months and it is relentless. The only thing my ultrasound ever showed was a fatty liver (which I have been told is not the source of my pain) and if even I did think it was this, my pain is central, not to the right (where your liver is) My endocopy a few years back only showed mild inflammation, could these be gastritis attacks? Any info/input would be greatly appreciated...thanks

"Hi Jenny,
I had your symptoms years ago and it took 2.1/2 years for doctors to tell me I had Mucous Colitis! I was put on three different drugs which did help but never put it away. I changed my life style/diet and that helped. I came off the medication because of the worry of all the dude affects! I was then tested positive for H-Pylori and was put on triple therapy antibiotics and felt better. But have gone on vicious cycle of infections v antibiotics and lots of inflammation!
Kidney stones could be another problem but they normally show up, I've had that snd it's agony!
I think bacteria in the gut is mostly the problem whether it shows up or not, there are so many different types of bacteria they don't always show up!
Try L-glutamine to repair the stomach lining 10-40 grams max and strong probiotics to reestsblish the good bacteria!. HP destroys the stomach lining and Mucosa and the antibiotics reek havoc on your system as they are so strong, they weaken the immune system and kill off all the good and bad bacteria which will change the delicate balance of flora in the body!
Slippery Elm helps protect the stomach too.
Good luck!

"Hi Pam, i can relate to your Flares as thats exactly what i have. I had an attack 3 weeks ago and all my stomach felt on fire and swollen, it was excruciating. My doctors said my stomach felt swollen as i told her i thought the swelling was affecting my bladder as i could feel pressure on it making me need to wee more often. I too was told i had a small patch of inflammation after an endoscopy, also a small hiatus hernia. I am really scared of it becoming a regular thing as i am worried what damage it can do to my stomach. Ihave had 2 ultrasounds this year and also told i have slightly fatty liver. Hope someone can come up with a way to help us all cure this painful condition.

Utrasound, endoscopy, cat scans all check out normal. I have seen 4 doctors, digestion specialists. Everyone says ""there is nothing wrong with you."" I questions if it could be anxiety related, but have been told it is not (even though is causes it) The last thing I was told was thast I must have gotten a bacterial infection that still lingers. I have been on pro-biotics and am currently taking panterprozale for stomach acid and slight inlfmation in my esophagus. I have vowed to find a ""cure"" for myself. Andi, I will. Knowing that you all are out there helps me know I am not in this alone. Anything I find, I will share. I have tried to describe it to other people, but they simpy cannot understand what it is to live with this day in and day out. It is constantly on my mind and I am sure all of yours. If anyone has heard of any new remedies please share.

"Thank you all so much for the information. I'm about 6 months into this problem, but I get severe pain in the middle of my chest too. My stomach hurts all the time and sometimes it's so bad I'm close to doubling over. I'm also nauseaus all the time, but don't vomit. The pain in my chest gets that bad too and will hurt into my back. Most times I feel hungry even after I've eaten a full meal, so I will try to eat something mild thinking it will help and then I'm really full and feel worse than when I started. And I'm gaining more weight because of all this. I don't need more weight given that I'm already obese. I suffer bouts of diarrhea and constipation, but nothing in between. Stress makes it 100 times worse. I take an antacid twice a day, drink Mylanta and eat antacids in between doses of the omaprozole. I'm seeing the specialist this coming Friday. Finally. I'm sick of feeling sick. I know I'm going to get an endoscopy, but I'm afraid they won't find anything treatable and I'll be sick with this for a long time, as I'm reading here today. Has anyone else had the chest pain too? I'm going to write stuff down that I've read here and will take that with me as questions on Friday. I pray that you all feel better soon and that someone figures this out so we all can get some relief. God Bless.

"Hi there Frances/Pam,
It looks like I'm in the same boat. About 3 years ago I began having stomach aches, dull pain in my stomach, like someone put a brick in there for fun. After about 2 weeks of constant pain I went through all the usual tests, from blood, scans, endo/colonoscopy, h-pylori, etc etc. Found nothing at all, slight inflammation of the stomach was all. Then was put on various diets, none of which helped matters, meanwhile I stopped drinking and taking fizzy drinks, fatty Foods, you name it!
3 months later, Docs said it was stress related and IBS was main diagnosis. I didn't lose weight, or had bathroom problems.
I thought I was truly doomed, then one day it went away like magic, literally magic. Haven't had the pain since until last week after a spicy meal. I thought it was just the food, but I'm a week in and quite honestly terrified. I don't know if I can go through another few months of this day in and day out.
These forums are wonderful places to meet and talk to people and they really do help.
Going to docs again this week and will keep you all posted.
Thanks to all
Richard

"Hi nick,
I have been suffering with severe pain and diarrhea for years now. 2 weeks ago I was hospitalized and did all the tests (colonoscopy, endoscopy, ultra sound, Xray, CT scan, MRI, stool and blood testing for bugs) EVERYTHING CAME OUT FINE. I am so frustrated as I am a college student trying to do well in school and being woken up by intense pain. I tried going paleo, now I'm just dairy free, they put me on anti biotics but I'm going to stop them because truthfully at this point I have little faith in western ""classic"" treatments and feel as if the answer lies in something more homeopathic. Have you had any luck? Thank you. This is such a struggle and so so frustrating.

"I wondered if anyone could help me, since about January 2013 I have on and off had a dull ache in my stomach, sometimes flaring up to make me feel sick. I actually put this down to anxiety however in the past few weeks my theory has changed.
About three weeks ago my stomach flared up however to the worst pain I have experienced as yet, made me feel like I was going to be sick constantly and made me not know what to do with myself. I feel like there is a lump in my thought and my stomach feels tender and swollen when flares up feels like my stomach is on fire/knotted up!
The pain was so sever I went to the doctors (2 and a half weeks ago), my doctor felt my stomach and said it felt swollen, I told her the symtoms and she says she thinks I have gastritis and prescribed me with Lansoprazole 30mg tablets to take daily for 1 month, this however to date hasn't helped my stomach at all, the flare up comes and goes however the pain in my stomach is constant and the Lansorprazole is causing terrible upset stomach to the point I am worried to not be near a toilet.
I went back to the doctors on Tuesday 22/10 explained all of the above to her and she said I am to keep taking the tablets and she is happy to see me again in November (once the months course has been taking) however im in dispear with this pain HAD ENOUGH OF FEELING ILL and can't help but think the worse
Has anyone experienced symptoms same as above as I feel extremely on my own shouting and no one understanding what im going though

"I have had these types of stomach issues as well however it the problem might not be your stomach but a
fibroid. I have vaginal fibroids and i get the same issues that you are having. The best way to find out if you have them is to get a ultra sound of you uterus and see if some thing shows up. What happens is these fibroids can grow big and cause stomach issues. I had one removed in March of last year and it was the size of a childs small football. It got to the point where most of my pant didn't fit because it made my stomach swollen. I hope

thank you so much for your message, very interesting and could definitely be a possibility! I had an ultrasound of my organs but nothing came up however maybe they wasn't thorough around my uterus?

"Just so you are aware as well fibroids can grow outside of the uterus so there is a special ultra sound done to help figure out where they are located. But there are some herbs that help with digestive upset. probotics are good as well as achdophlis sorry about the spelling. These help calm the stomach. Chastberry is good to help reduce the fibroids as well. Sometime seeing a natural path helps then the regular doctor
I hope you feel better soon

"Hi Jenny,
I had stomach pain, bloating , nausea and really bad periods. The pain would vary from really bad to just like cramps. My last fibroid got so big it was affecting my kidney. I had trouble going to the bathroom because it go so big. Small fibroids can just make you uncomfortable. There are two types of ultrasounds, the first is one where they put the gel on you and move it around over your uterus. The other is that they put wand with a camera in side of your uterus and see if there is any fibroids and the location of them. I hope this helps

"Hi everyone! I have similar symptoms for about 6 yrs now. I've been in and out of hospitals trying to figure out what's wrong, my last visit was last week and I was in the hospital for 2 days. I had an ultrasound, and tons of blood tests and a stool sample test. They wanted to do an endoscopy but they decided it wasn't the best time since I'm 27 weeks pregnant. Blood work came out great and I'm still waiting to hear on the stool sample plus a separate blood test to check for an auto immune disease. My pain starts below the rib cage and extends to my right backside. The ultrasound came back normal. Gallbladder, lived, and pancreas looked fine but I'm still having this extreme pain. They think it could be a number of things...possibly microscopic gallstones, possibly an auto immune disease, possibly celiac disease, or even the pancreas but can only be sure until I have that endoscopy. I'm due in June so I can't wait! I also wanted to mention that the only thing that seems to take the pain away for small amounts of time is a heating pad. They prescribed me Zantac 150 mg and some lidocaine patches which haven't helped. I just want answers and soon.

"Hello Crystal67692; I pray by now you have found relief from your GI symptoms. For many years, I also have suffered with all kinds of persistant abdominal pain and discomfort. Three different doctors, Gastroenterologist, could not come up with anything more than IBS (Irritated Bowel Syndrom). If you have not been able to find the etiology of your pain, you might try getting off all dairy products. A drug named Bentyl helps with my cramps along with a heating pad.

"Victoria - have you had your CT Scan Yet? I went back to the doctors last week absolutely useless! The doctor I saw said ""you have ibs"" and prescribed me laxatives! (I do not need laxitives to say the least!) anyway, I went to my chemist (he is fantastic I would say better than I doctor) He said ""don't take this prescription - yes it is a laxitve and I don't think you have ibs!"" he said to go to the supermarket and buy ""ONKEN NATURAL YOGURT"" and take a tablespoon morning, lunch and night, basically this has live good bacteria in (acidiphilu in particular which is what I have been taking in tablet form) he said the live yogurt is better and the tablets are processed ect.
So I have been doing just that for just under a week now, only time will tell, my chemist thinks that its an imbalance of bacteria in my stomach which is causing this and by having this yogurt after time it should even itself out again and become normal! I have stopped my Acidiphilus tablets and just having the yogurt.... only time will tell.
Meanwhile one good thing about going to the doctors, I asked to be referred to see the stomach specialist again, so I am now booked in to see my specialist end of April (nhs is a waiting game) so hopefully he will refer me for a CT scan as that was what he said last time!
I haven't tried the aloe vera yet, im going to see how I get on with the yogurt and take it from there.
Good luck all, lets hope we all get to the bottom of this and QUICK! so we can get our lives back!

"Regarding aloe vera my wife finds that the liquid is more effective than the capsules.
Presumably as that is the juice from the plant rather than a powder or gel.
It is surprising the number of products that contain aloe vera nowadays. I've even seen aloe vera treated socks.
When we were in Tobago on holiday a guy carrying aloe vera leaves went round the beach offering to rub them over people whose skin was red from the sun.

"Back again:-)
If you Google ""Ask the Diet Doctor: The Truth About Aloe Vera Juice""
It has pros and cons about it. Including a scare store about trials on animals with unfiltered gel.
The filtered juice used by humans had a better write up.
""But it's not all bad news for aloe vera juice. In a 2004 study from the U.K., researchers gave people with active ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease, aloe vera gel to drink (remember that in the animal study, they used aloe vera juice, not gel). After four weeks of drinking aloe vera gel in water twice per day, there was a clinical response towards improvement and remission of ulcerative colitis, compared to those given plain water. No significant negative side effects were experienced due to drinking the aloe vera gel.
As you can see, the aloe vera story is not as clear cut as many drink labels want you to believe. My personal recommendation is that you should wait for more human research to show that aloe vera provides significant health benefits without negative side effects. If you do choose to drink aloe vera at this time, check with your doctor first, and then make sure that whatever product you use does not contain Aloin""
Anyway my wife has been taking it for about 19 years and is still here to tell the tale.

"From Pulse the GP's journal commenting on an apple a day and ginger biscuits!
For years because of not being good at getting up in the morning my breakfast consisted of two ginger biscuits and a cup of tea. I ate several apples a day as our house at that time had been built on the site of an orchard.
""If only that was true. If the simple ‘Granny Smith’ prevented the swathe of minor ailments that came in each day, I’m sure a GP’s workload would be far better. But did you know that eating an apple daily could stave off the discomfort of acid reflux? And so it would seem can many items found in your local supermarket.
Recently, I’ve had two incidences of positive feedback (yes - it’s amazing!) regarding treatment advice I gave for nausea. In both cases, I had advised eating a humble ginger biscuit and in both cases the feedback was it worked surprisingly well. One patient was shocked that a young-ish doctor like myself would suggest ginger over a prescribed anti-emetic. From personal experience of being on a boat pre- scuba diving, ginger was a great cure for my sea-sickness.
Following on from those episodes, a colleague emailed everyone asking if there were any non-pharmalogical cures for reflux. Homeopathy was mentioned but I suspect a millionth dilution of ‘eye of newt’ or such like is unlikely to cure acid reflux. And that’s where using Dr Google brought up a plethora of websites toting natural remedies for reflux - some of which I had previously heard of such as chewing gum and some that seemed counter-intuitive, but seemed to work, like necking a teaspoon of mustard.
GPs tend to prescribe a lot of medications for common ailments, based on patient demand and the evidence base, but often the horrible side effects can put people off taking the drugs, further leading to re-attendance. I recently found out that a drug I used to prescribe regularly as a hospital doctor, has a less than flattering nickname in some circles because it can make some patients quite paranoid and anxious - not a side effect you want to get just for treating sickness!
Whilst I’m not advocating natural remedies for all ailments, many doctors are probably already suggesting treatments because of previous knowledge or experience, for example sage for menopausal hot flushes, peppermint tea for bowel cramps (peppermint oil is a prescribable drug anyway!), camomile tea for relaxation to name a few. Since the time of Hippocrates, the bark extract of the willow has long been used in medicine for treating inflammation and fever and now is prescribed regularly for secondary prevention in cardiac disease. Any ideas what it is?
If suggesting natural remedies with little or no side effects can improve a patients’ well-being, save the NHS a few pennies and increase my positive feedback rate, I reckon that’s no bad thing!""

"Hi, Jenny, my husband has had the same symptoms for over a year. We went to Domnican Republic and many of our group were ill with sickness diarroheah. My husband wasn't ill at the time but got ill when we got home. He was diagnosed with h pylori and took two courses of the three treatments (2 antibiotics and one gastro medicine). He didn't get any better and now having had two endoscopies, a colonoscopy, a CT scan, including putting dye into his body, two ultrasound scans, numerous blood tests, stool samples etc everything is coming back clear. He too was given laxatives despite not being constipated. He was told by one doctor that it was probably (!) IBS but he has none of the usual IBS symptoms. At the last appointment he was given a further blood test to look for coealic disease. We are due back to see consultant on 24 April. I (we) are almost positive it is not coealiac as he is not sick, does not have diarrohea. His symptoms are constant nausea coupled with stomach pain and the feeling of being stabbed between shoulder blades.

"Hi Maria, I see that your post is very old but I have to try at least. My mom has been suffering from the same symptoms as your husband. An excruciating pain in her stomach or pancreatic area, she has gone through all the tests - endoscopie, a colonoscopy, a CT scan, two ultrasound scans, numerous blood tests, stool samples etc and everything comes out good. Based on her results she should be the healthiest person on Earth but she's in so much pain anytime she eats anything or drinks anything. Now she's basically not eating to prevent the pain, but she's loosing tons of weight and we are worried how much longer can she live like this. I see you wrote that some doctor said that there is some part of a stomach that is hard to see from any kind of test . Have you had any luck figuring out what was the problem with your husband? I really hope that you have already figured it out and that your husband is feeling better now. Please let me know if you have any update or any information that could help us. Thank you! Martina

"Hi Jenny.
I haven't seen a post from you in the last couple of months, I hope your pain got better!!
I found your story interesting as I have a similar problem in the past 6 YEARS....
It all started in 2008 when I was diagnosed with pancreatitis.
After a couple of days of hospitalisation and diet I was free to go home however I had to go back for blood tests to check if my pancreas is all good.
The blood test came back, pancreas is good but my thrombocyts (red blood cells) are waaaay to low (Normally you'd have 250 000, I had 30 000) which is causing bleeding. Everywhere. Anytime. Internal as well. So I was hospitalised again, for weeks.
I had a blood condition which I was prescribed STEROIDS for.. (Medrol).
Started with 8mg a day, finished with 120 mg/a day till the day of my splenectomy, (there were a few months between starting medication and surgery, because my blood was too runny, they couldn't cut me, so I had to increase the dose all the time to be able to have a surgery) because they had to remove my spleen in order to stop me from the blood conditon. I was 18 back then. I've put on 30 kg in 1 year, and the steroids have done so much damage to my body, you can't imagine both inside an out...
In the hospital all they said to me was: ""Be careful with the steroids, the can cause you stomach pain""... Well, appareantly I wasn't careful enough because I've been living with this unexplainable pain in the past 6 YEARS!!!!!
I was told that your body needs about 5 years to get rid of the traces of steroids which was last year and nothing happened....
I was taking probiotics and different tablets for stomach care but nothing worked.
I've been trying to find out what causes the pain for 5-6 years now, with no success....
I wake up early in the morning (around 4-5am) for the pain, and am awake until it settles. Usually it gets better if I eat or drink something, otherwise it makes my life miserable, I can become very grumpy. It happens during the day as well, so basically when my stomach starts to feel empty (every 3-4 hours) it gives me the ""sign""....
So I usually associate the pain with hunger.... If i eat, it gets better, if not, it just gets worse
I've done all sorts of tests, tried gastroscopy, tablets, vitamins and nothing seemed to ease my pain.
When I had my tests done, the doctor came to me saying that the good news is that everything is fine, and the bad news is that everything is fine... So it's very good that there are no visible symptoms of some serious condition, but it doesn't help me and I can't have a good quality of life at the age of 24.
I always have to make sure I've got some snacks in my bag otherwise I panic and become agitated again.
Obviously I have weight problems since then, ( I was about 65 kg when the problem started, and I'm almost a 100 kg now... very sad and scary).
I can't really lose weight, but I can gain kilos very quickly and easily..
It's hard to explain to my mind for example that I'm not hungry and I do not need those carbs, but my body tells me otherwise and in order to keep my body happy and to be able to work, I have to give my body what it ""needs"" otherwise i can't function...
I've tried to settle my stomach pain with fruits, nuts, good fats and healthy stuff but I've got a feeling that I'm now addicted to carbohydrates and if I don't have it, the pain will kill me.........it's a vicious circle, because I need to stop eating so much carbs for the pain the go away, but if I don't have it I feel hungry ALL THE TIME.
Anyway, this is my little story about stomach pains, I feel what you feel, and I really hope that your pain will go away very soon because it's not something you can live with forever...

"I'm amazed reading you, its as if i had written it myself!
Could not believe, how similar symptoms are. I have dealt with it since twenties. Now i'm 60. It has gotten worse with years. The only thing that does help me is a very strong and expensive probiotic pill which I take every morning.
I have also gained weight that its hard to get rid off. Its a negative circle, since the more wait you gain and the more sick you become, the more tired and less energy to exercise you are.
i have been diagnosed w: IBS, lactose intolerance, etc, etc. but no treatment has been successful.

"I know it's been quite some time since you posted this, but as my (actually my husband's) issue is more current, I thought I'd take the chance and see if you're still around and posting. What struck me about your post is this: it's the only one I've seen so far which mentions being woken up by abdominal pain/cramping and having something to eat makes it a little better. This is exactly what happens to my husband!! He had an endoscopy which indicated acid reflux, then a colonoscopy which showed diverticulosis, along.with some polyps which were removed. Last December his appendix ruptured, surgery was successful, but the broad spectrum antibiotics left hand with the c-diff bug, which I'm wondering is the culprit for these other issues. He'd been having some waking up cramps prior to the surgery, but it seems things have been ""stirred up"" a lot more since then. Anyway, to make a long story at least a little bit shorter, his GI doc tried a few different things but finally decided he didn't want to see us anymore because he couldn't figure out what it was. I've wondered about SIBO, gastroparesis, some sort of intestinal motility issues, and a few other things. We're in the process of finding a.new GI, but as you well know, it's very disheartening to keep trying.things and getting nowhere. Have you been able to get anywhere with your search for relief? I hope so, and would truly appreciate any reply. Keep the faith, and hope to hear from you soon.

"I cannot believe how identical your stomach aches are to mine. Word for word it could have been written by me. I was wondering if you've managed to find any solution to the pain?
I have found these small capsules that relieve gas and bloating that seem to ease intense pain but doesn't exsctly get rid of it. I also find that any stress can make it worse. The problem is I have had some severe health problems in the past so the doctors just say that those problems are the cause when I just kniw they are not!

From reading this thread, it seems like with so many people with these issues, the gastroenterology field.would be working a little harder with us all. Oh well.
What I would recommend (and I have no doubt you've done your fair share of this) is continue to haunt the Internet for ideas based upon your symptoms and then haunt your doctor to work with you. Hopefully we've found a GI doc who seems to actually be interested in helping people rather than just randomly trying drugs and then bailing out.
Please keep me posted on your progress and your adventures in the world of gastric. Take care and keep trying ... there's a solution, I'm sure.

"Hello I found your post on your husbands stomach pain while one of my desperately attempts to get to the bottom of my own stomach issues through the Internet anyways he sounds like he's did suffering from turbo same exact thing Iam even down to the appendix and c diff bug I realize that this post is older but I was curious if he has gotten any better if you found help or a diagnosis?? I'm a 30 year old mother of two and I'm sad to say that some days I don't want to be here because of this stomach pain I just want some answers and a doctor who will do the work to find out what's wrong! Thank you so much for your time! -Amber

"I wondered if anyone could help me, since about January 2013 I have on and off had a dull ache in my stomach, sometimes flaring up to make me feel sick. I actually put this down to anxiety however in the past few weeks my theory has changed.
About three weeks ago my stomach flared up however to the worst pain I have experienced as yet, made me feel like I was going to be sick constantly and made me not know what to do with myself. I feel like there is a lump in my thought and my stomach feels tender and swollen when flares up feels like my stomach is on fire/knotted up!
The pain was so sever I went to the doctors (2 and a half weeks ago), my doctor felt my stomach and said it felt swollen, I told her the symtoms and she says she thinks I have gastritis and prescribed me with Lansoprazole 30mg tablets to take daily for 1 month, this however to date hasn't helped my stomach at all, the flare up comes and goes however the pain in my stomach is constant and the Lansorprazole is causing terrible upset stomach to the point I am worried to not be near a toilet.
I went back to the doctors on Tuesday 22/10 explained all of the above to her and she said I am to keep taking the tablets and she is happy to see me again in November (once the months course has been taking) however im in dispear with this pain HAD ENOUGH OF FEELING ILL and can't help but think the worse
Has anyone experienced symptoms same as above as I feel extremely on my own shouting and no one understanding what im going though

"It's amazing to read that I am not the only one who is struggling with daily stomach pains. I feel so bad for each and every one of you because I know how terrible and frustrating it is to be in pain every day and not be able to figure out why it's happening.
I am 28 years old, I don't smoke, I don't drink, I don't drink coffee or soda, I eat healthy and only drink water, I am not overweight either. I should not be having such problems and yet I am in pain more days than I am not. I have noticed that my stomach started to get upset in 2007 when I started to drink coffee more regularly, but it wasn't nearly as bad as it is now....almost 7 years later (I don't drink cofee anymore though). I have cut out so many foods already out of my diet and already eat very basic foods such as rice and chicken, yet nothing seems to be improving the condition of my stomach. I, as well, had MANY MANY tests done and everything comes back normal. One of my endoscopies a few years back showed that I have chronic gastritis but the doctor's do not seem to be very concerned with that, maybe because my other tests came back normal...such as stool and coloncospy. I have visited 3 different gastroenterologists and I try to do my own research and my poor mom also constantly sends me articles and solutions. All of these articles only say that you have to watch your diet, but I already do!!! I don't eat acid, I don't eat fried food, I stopped eating spicy food, I started to avoid gluten. WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?!! This is so upsetting. Last week I had a really bad pain episode and was up all night and I was so upset. The next morning I ran to my regular physician so that she could check me out while the pain was happening, I broke down in her office in tears. She ran more blood tests and I did another breath test for hp pylori. I am seeing her tomorrow to follow up. I also sent an email to my GI almost a month ago, explaining to him that the acid reducer meds he prescribed are not working and I'm still suffering. I asked what will be the next steps for treatment...I am still waiting to hear from him. That's another thing that upsets me so bad is that no one seems to realize and understand the pain that we are constantly in and this waiting for weeks and sometimes months for appointments that do not provide any kind of solutions is just torture!
I feel like I am at the point where I do not care what I have to do in order to feel better. I have no other health issues. When my stomach doesn't hurt, I feel great! Such a difference! But when it does, I have no energy, my stomach is bloated and I don't feel like doing anything, I feel disgusting and in pain. I don't care if I have to get a surgery or stop eating bread or dairy, whatever I need to do! This may sound terrible and of course I would never do it, but sometimes I feel like I just want to stab myself in the stomach because I'm just so tired of dealing with this every single day of my life and there's no one that can help me. Every time I call to make an appointment with my GI, he's always booked and I have to wait a months...how much longer will this go on!?
I am sorry about the rant, I'm sure you can sense how frustrated I am with this, as I'm sure you are as well. I really hope that we could be fixed so that we could go on having happy and healthy lives with no pain (I can't imagine what that will be like! It's been so long since I felt good). Let's keep our fingers crossed. I will run by my doctors some of the suggestions that I read on here..such as aloe vera and acidophilus, we'll see what she says.
Good luck everyone! If anyone has anymore good tips or advise, it will be more than appreciated!

"Hi there, my name is Jared and I reside in Barrie Ontario Canada. I am 26 years old and have been suffering from similar g.I problems for over seven years. Gone for abdominal ultrasounds, c.t scans, mri's upper g.i's, celiac screens among many other tests, and the results always come up as normal regardless of the fact that I wake up every morning with excruciating stomach pain. I have been told I have non-ulcer dyspepsia which basically means they can't specify the problem and they don't have a treatment option. I have been taking 25mg of amitriptyline every night which is meant to block pain signals being sent from my brain to my stomach but has provided minimal relief. The only medication I have found to be somewhat effective for my problem is buscopan, an anti-spasmodic which seems to be one of the few things that temporarily ease my pain. I have also tried altering my diet, cutting out fat and fried and acidic foods but I didn't see much relief.
It is kind of funny how common this problem is and yet everyone who goes through this has a very similar experience. Endless trial and error with no real answers or assistance from physicians.I believe this problem is caused primarily by the preservatives, the GMO's, the BPA and all the other man made chemicals they've created to make our food taste better or last longer.I hope that one day they are able to treat people of theses unbearable issues. I hope everyone here can find relief in some way and any helpful info on this matter would be appreciated

"Hi I know this post his old but I cannot believe how similar thoughts I have at this moment in time. I had terrible pains 3 or so years ago for months on end. I was so down. I then found one probiotic in the morning and aloe Vera at night worked wonders and my bought severely reduced to about once a quarter and the longest being 2 weeks. That was however until 5 weeks ago when I had a sudden flare for no reason. I too just want to stab my stomach and see what's going on. It may go off for an hour and I'm totally different and positive. It's like a light switch. I'm now getting very depressed and emotional (I'm a 44 year old man!) and it's starting to affect my family as I'm very irritable. I just hope I can get back to how I was but I'm not helping with getting stressed. Going back to Dr's as feel this cannot just be IBS. Hope you got sorted.

"Hi All,
Just to let you know, i am yet to make any progress as yet, after 2 months of waiting my consultation with the stomach specialist is finally tomorrow morning! It can't come quick enough!
Nothing has changed with me if I am honest, i have been keeping a food diary (nothing is standing out that could be causing my stomach problems can happen one week but not the next if i have eaten the same things). I have been taking my spoon full of Onken Natural yogurt 3 x a day for over a month now, I have also been drinking 2 x peppermint tea a day too (apparently good for your digestive system) unfortunately still not cured.
Every day that goes by I am just getting used to the fact that this is going to be with me forever, it makes me miserable and things that i should enjoy aren't enjoyable, I had my friends wedding for example last Friday, Thursday my stomach flared up terribly again ALL DAY! luckily it went down by Friday however i was sitting on the edge of my seat all day worrying it was going to flare again .
I definately understand all of your frustrations.
Maria - its interesting how you say that your husband got these sympthoms after getting ill on holiday as that is exactly what happened to me! I went on holiday September 2012 got really ill (extrememly bad diorea for 24+ hours) ever since this holiday my problems started, intermitantly at first till October last year where i have it every day!
I am lucky that i am strong minder and no matter what i power through and live my every day life, I continue to go to work with the pain and out with friends, however some days its torture but I am determind not to let this get the better of me!
Fingers crossed for tomorrow and see what the consultant says my next steps are!
I will keep you all posted.
Good luck to you all - PLEASE keep us all posted if any of you get a miracle cure!

"Hi Jenny, my husband was back at hospital this morning and has come away feeling a bit more optimistic. he saw a different consultant who is doing some more blood tests and stool samples. He said that he will check again for the h.pylori bacteria as despite my husband having already taken two courses of the treatment for the bacteria following his illness on holiday in Feb 2013, some forms of it can be resistant to particular antibiotics. He is also going to get his Gp to prescribe some different medications so I will keep you posted. He mentioned as well that there is a part of the stomach which still cannot be seen from either an endoscopy or a colonoscopy so he is looking into this as well.

"Hi jenny33426! My name is leticia and I started having stomach pain and I thought it was because of my back diet. Because I don't eat very much and it's the pain it's right in the middle of my stomach and it goes to my shoulder blades. And I also have fibromyalgia and that doesn't help but I can't take the pain anymore it hurts so bad in the makes me throw up sometimes especially if I eat something. I don't like to eat so it makes it harder on me and I'm getting scared because this is the first time I'm reading that a lot of women and men have the same problem. I feel your pain because my pain makes me cry😪 I haven't gone to the doctor for the stomach pain I'm scared he's going to tell me I have something bad and then I feel like I did it to myself for trying to being a crazy diet! I'm 50 years old and sometimes I feel like I'm definitely not going to wake up. I just can't believe all the people that have the stomach pain just like mine I thought I was in makes me feel good reading and trying to find an answer!I pray you're doing better and you don't have the pain no more hopefully they fixed two maybe you could give me the answer?

"Another update;
On Friday 25/04 - had an appt with my stomach specialist, explained that i am still getting upset stomach every morning, occassional bouts of my stomach bloating excessively (once a month or so) and the odd days weekly that i just generally don't feel well.
Next step he said is capsule camera! basically a tablet that you swallow that has a camera in it and takes images throughout its journey through your digestive system! amazing ay!
Now its another waiting game to wait for this appt to come through.
Even though i have already had the Endoscope and Colonoscope this goes through your small intestines to see if there is any kind of disease there (the others can't go through your small intestines.
Will keep you all posted! the never ending journey continues!

"Hi Jenny,
I found your post very interesting. I too have been suffering from the exact same symptoms you have. It's been going on for nearly a year and so far the docs are no help.
About 2 weeks ago I had enough and took myself to emergency. They did an ultrasound and said everything looked fine over than the fact that I have gallstones. The doctor said however that my symptoms are not likely caused by that and that I probably have an ulcer. She prescribed me Pantoloc and said to keep taking it 2x a day until I feel better. Then stop, see if the symptoms return, go do the breathe test for h.pylori and we'll go from there. Ugh.
I really didn't feel great about her ""diagnoses"" so I went to see my family doc. He suggested that it's the gallstones and that I should see a surgeon. He put in a refferal for me but says it could take months to get in. Not to mention that I'm not sure my symptoms match that of gallstones. Sigh.
Im so lost. This is really ruining my quality of life. I hate living in pain and I have no clue what to do about it.
Did is you ever take the aloe?
I hope we all get relief soon!

"Hello Jen,
Sorry to read you are also suffering, its unbelievable how many people seem to have very simular syphtoms and also struggling for a diagnosis! Frightening really!
The only advise i can give is to persist until you are happy with the outcome, as your the one suffering in the pain its easy for doctors to fob you off!
No I have tried aloe yet to be honest, at the moment I am not taking any medication, and my stomach just goes in waves of feeling ok and then bad other days! I just take each day as it comes until my next appt for the capsule camera.
I hope you find some answers/relief soon also !

"Hi Jenny, I have had the same problem now for over a couple years. I have had my esophagus stretched 3 times and not helped. The only think that releives the pain is drinking down a bottle of water until the pain is gone. I have problems and unable to burp making the pain even more unbearable. I have been under a lot of stress in the last well all my life. I am happier now but as I was growing up, if I got stressed out, my stomach would knot up and I couldn't eat. Anyway I have had the burium swallow and all that but I think I am going to go see a chiropractor. I know my neck is out and well, it wouldn't hurt to see if that could help.

"Hi Jenny, I've read through everyone's post and i'm so sorry to hear you are all going through immense pain or uncomfortable times. It sure isn't pleasant as I have recently experienced something similar but not all the symptoms everyone's mentioned.
A couple of weeks ago, I had not eaten for a couple of days due to work and laziness and the only thing i had was a manky mango that afternoon. That night the stomach started to get uncomfortable and remained the same the next day. The next two nights was unbearable pains from ribs to waist, all over. Bloated, nausea, pain, farting (sorry passing wind), for the first week. Attended the doctors 3 times that week, to be told food poisoning to trapped wind. I am a bad eater, so I started to have 3 meals a day, then i had an ultra scan, I had been given pain killers to digestion tablets, to bacteria killing tablets, allsorts. Nothing was working not even the injection to kill instant pain.
As I live in an African Country, i took myself to Dubai after a week.
Had a CT scan which showed clear and another ultra sound, they still couldnt see anything. I had mentioned before that my sister had intestine problems and they have only left her with 10% intestine, in her stomach, but after my scan I brought up the fact that she was born with organs in the wrong place. That is when they then realised that my pancreas is above my stomach and not below.
Now I am awaiting their next advice, as they wanted to go through the scans again. My pains have gone, and maybe i am thinking it was a bactrial virus, that took it's time getting out.
Strange with all the technology, and continously people having these systoms, (which a friend of mine is having for the past 2 years), that no cure has been found.
Sorry not much help and not saying that the out of places organs were the cause, nor that everyone else has the same, but maybe an option to bring up to your doctor. You never know.
good luck all !!

hi Jenny ,
same problems recently found out that I have food intolarences check the above link as its really helped.
four years on from taking lazoperazole for acid reflux I find out through my own research that lanzoperaloze is not that good for us ,, we need acid in our stomachs but lanzoperaloze not only reducing the stomach making acid it also stops vital vitamins and minerals from entering the body just like a sponge..
im currently on a seclusion diet basically preteen shakes and I introduce certain foods and keep a diary and I have to be honest wheat makes me really I'll gluten makes me I'll msg in Chinese food and certain fruit and veg.
i have lost two stone but what I have found out really helps me build a benchmark, for years I have dealt with stress ( food related I now believe) I also have panick attacks and feel like I'm choking on food so if it does not digest I'm usually sick..
Yes I get acid reflux but only from certain foods also I have intolarences .
ive had a long list of symptoms including fatigue sickness stress dizziness foggy brain generally run down and I'm putting this all down to what my body accepts or does not accept as its fuel..
good luck everyone really appreciate reading your comments

"I've experienced basically same thing after getting permanent diabetes after having it w all 3 of my boys! I started with really bad stomach pains so bad that I was doubled over and went to the ER for the first time many years ago.I was told that I had good news and bad news one that was diabetic n 2 I have really bad gastritis! which is usually activated they said when my sugar is really high over 300 which it does all the times it also drops really low and I'm hypoglycemic also.I spent almost seven have eight years in gymnastics for about 8 hours a day. I've and got hit by a car back in 2001actually it was a 4x4 truck Toyota 4runnerwith a big,black grade steel guard on the front. so the only thing I suggest is that you can go to a pain clinic.They are the only one I can write you pain medicine for what you're going through.a doctor can only write so many prescriptions for pain before the have to send you to a pain clinic.it seems you have insurance I do too through Ford Motor Company so I don't know how different it would be for you to go but 13 years ago it was hard to find one there is only two in my state now they're like Starbucks, thier on every corner!

"hey Jenny. I have gone through the exact problems you have. I was diagnosed with IBS. I went through the ultrasound and endoscopy also everything came back normal.
I thought I'd let you know what has helped me. I stopped drinking pop. I went to juice that doesnt have much sugar in it, water and tea. I know everyone is different. It could be worth a shot though.
I hope you feel better soon. I hated not knowing what was happening to my body. The pain was unbearable and all I could do was cry. I was always afraid that I would get sick of I left the house. It controlled my life terribly bad. Ever since I stopped drinking pop I go out without having to worry! My doctors here in the US put me on a GI relaxer called rubnil (not sure if I spelt it right.) Let me know what you find out maybe it could help me also!

"Hello Megan,
Thank you for messaging. How interesting, did you feel unwell on a daily basis or was it intermitant?
Basically to let you know where i am now with it all I decided I couldn't go through with the Capsule Camera at the moment so have come away from seeing doctors etc for the time being as to be honest I felt as if I was going around in circles and thought i would keep a ANOTHER diary and see if i notice any patterns myself.
Thankfully I am currently not getting the horrific sypthoms i was getting on a daily basis (diroea, horrific swollen stomach and feeling sick) however now I am getting it a couple of times a week which generally lasts 2 - 3 days depending on how bad it is.
Last time I went to see my GP he just said ""its IBS"" however I found hard to accept such a flippent diagnosis considering IBS is undiagnosable?
Interesting that you say by stopping fizzy drinks helped you... has it stopped your syptoms all together? If it has I will definately give this a try! I am however quite good on the drinks from I have 1 x Tea, 2 x pepermint Tea, 2L of water & 1 can of sprite a day...
However i am definately prepared to stop drinking the sprite if that helped you!
It is the most horrible thing in the world having something wrong with you and not knowing what it is and not having anything to make you feel better. It really does ruin your life as that is all you think about.
I will look forward to hearing from you regarding the above, and thanks again for sharing with me.

"Hi jenny or anyone else that's on this thread, what are all of your symptoms? For the past 2 months I have been in complete agony with stomach pains. I have been to the ER a number of times and they have done blood work and ultra sounds and have came up with nothing. I have been to my GI 2 times in the past couple weeks and he has tried me on 2 different medicines that have not helped at all. I went in on Wednesday and had a ct scan ran with the dye being injected in me and all and I am now awaiting those results. I am a nervous wreck to hear my results cause I have bad health anxiety and I always always think the worst. I am a 32 year old female and my symptoms are severe bloating 24/7, I can't eat but a few bites of food before being really full, I have already lost 10 lbs in 2 weeks, I am a little constipated I believe, even though I don't eat a lot so I don't know if that's why I can't use the bathroom or not. I feel like I'm full of gas but it only comes out every now and then, and when I strain or cough or put any strain on my stomach there's something in there that hurts really really bad. It's a very sharp pain and like somethings pulling. I'm in complete misery over all this stomach pain. It's 2:30 in the morning right now and my stomach pain has woke me up. Which is why I'm desperately searching for answers. Do any of you suffer from severe stomach bloating? To the point where your stomach feels sore. Any replies would be greatly appreciated!!!! I will add that some days I don't even wanna get out the bed I'm in so much pain. And I also feel weak and have just a bad feeling all the time 😢

"I wondered if anyone could help me, since about January 2013 I have on and off had a dull ache in my stomach, sometimes flaring up to make me feel sick. I actually put this down to anxiety however in the past few weeks my theory has changed.
About three weeks ago my stomach flared up however to the worst pain I have experienced as yet, made me feel like I was going to be sick constantly and made me not know what to do with myself. I feel like there is a lump in my thought and my stomach feels tender and swollen when flares up feels like my stomach is on fire/knotted up!
The pain was so sever I went to the doctors (2 and a half weeks ago), my doctor felt my stomach and said it felt swollen, I told her the symtoms and she says she thinks I have gastritis and prescribed me with Lansoprazole 30mg tablets to take daily for 1 month, this however to date hasn't helped my stomach at all, the flare up comes and goes however the pain in my stomach is constant and the Lansorprazole is causing terrible upset stomach to the point I am worried to not be near a toilet.
I went back to the doctors on Tuesday 22/10 explained all of the above to her and she said I am to keep taking the tablets and she is happy to see me again in November (once the months course has been taking) however im in dispear with this pain HAD ENOUGH OF FEELING ILL and can't help but think the worse

"I was having burning pains in my upper abdomen daily, I also excessively burped and had LPR (silent reflux). I couldn't prevent these symptoms and they were so persistent I genuinely thought I was dying of stomach cancer for months and I thought nobody was taking me seriously and that I was going to be dead within the year. Googling your symptoms is some scary stuff. I think the stress itself is what made it worse. Now the symptoms will only appear if I drink alcohol or fizzy drinks. I still had to avoid many spicy types of food too which sucks I guess but anything is better than cancer

"Hi there Jenny my name is Jenny as well. So sorry your going through something so smiliar to my problem. I thought I was the only one. Our sysmptoms are so similiar expect that my stomach is so huge and my weight is going crazy. One day I have a perfect regular flat stomach and suddenly I start swelling I go super huge people even ask me if im pregnant. My stomach gets supper huge, hard, and heavy. Ive had numerous of tests done like; upper endoscopys, colonoscpopys, thousands of blood tests, collected urine to have it tested, numerous of cts scans, ultrasounds, and xrays. Weve pretty much have done everything in the book. Im close to almost 3 months with this condition now. Its super diffucult to sleep, eat and sometimes even breath. I havent worked in a long time now due to all of these sysmptoms. None of the hydrocodine pills work any more. They first diagnosed me with IBS but none of the treatments worked for me. Ive done these crazy diets where I cant eat anything and only drink water and my stomach still seems to get bigger. I can't fit in any of my clothes. I feel like i'm going insane with all of these tests results being completly normal. Have you gotten any better? Any results?

"Hello Jenny, my name is Riley. I have been suffering from the same symptoms for about 3 weeks now. Doctors have taken blood and stool samples and everything has come back as normal. Every morning my body wakes me up at around 8-9 and I am very ill for about 3-4 hours and then I am back to my normal self. The pain is very excruciating and I am more just annoyed that i havent slept in past 8 for 3 weeks. Doctors have ruled out a couple things, they say it could be IBS but i dont meet all the symptoms that IBS sufferers have. Anyways I was just woundering if you have heard anything new as of late. By the way I am 17 years old and this condition is ruining my social life and making me very depressed. I just wish there was somthing that i could do to make it go away

"Hi crystal1976,
I'm 20 years old and was suffering with exactly what you have described for more than 13 months, trying various medications, etc, before realising that I have had anxiety for a number of years, and it is what causer my stomach problems (crazy, I know). It turned into a vicious cycle because I (just like your daughter) was so afraid to eat anything in case it made me feel sick and in turn that made the anxiety worse, and so on. Although this might be a special case, maybe you should ask your daughter about this, because I was told that its more common than you would think . a few days after realising the cause, and after going to a councikker, I learned that deep breathing is a major help, and in the last 2 weeks my appetite is back to normal and my stomach is much more settled. I'm not 100% better but its getting there! I really hope this helps because I truely feel her pain, it was a nightmare.

"Hi, I've had similar problems for the past 4 years. I've been to so many doctors and no one knows what's wrong with me and all the tests would come back negative. For me I had a lot of acid reflux where it would go to my chest throat and ears. It was constant 24/7 and many days because of it I cannot go to sleep. I have quit working because I just can't function with the pain and the sleepless nights. Eventually a doctor diagnosed me with gastroparesis which is the food not clearing fast enough from your stomach to your intestine therefore it could cause a plethora of problems. However I don't think that is what is causing all of my pain. The only thing that I really helped me was magnesium supplements. When I take it my body is just calm but it also caused soo much side effects that I just cannot be on it. I think my real problem is that my stomach muscles are in constant spasm. Recently my doctor prescribed a calcium channel blocker and that also seem to help, they are suppose to dialate the blood vessels so that your muscles can relax usually prescribed for people who have high blood pressure.
I started having this problem in my late 20s and because I look young and healthy, no one took me seriously, the only thing they ever related my problem to would be an eating disorder which I've never had! I am Asian and naturally thin and since I have had the stomach problems I've lost about another 10 pounds (I normally weigh 107 and I am 5'7) so that's a lot of weight to loose. And of course after hearing that all the specialist would again bring up anorexia as a potential cause.
I've literally tried pretty much everything, from aloe to zinc l-carnosine etc etc and by trial and error found that my problem has to be related to smooth muscle spasms and perhaps with neurotransmitters and hormones that are regulating the actions of the stomach.
Anyway I still don't know exactly what the problem is but I am getting closer, so don't give up if you are still experiencing pain. In my experience most doctors don't listen and they will never spend as much time as you researching your symptoms. Because you are not dying anytime within the month, therefore you are not that high in their priority list. So you have to be your own advocate.

"Hello Jenny. I found this thread while trying to figure out what is wrong with my 10 year old son. He has had similar stomach issues for almost 3 weeks now. It seems to always be bad in the morning and evening, we have been eating healthier but that hasn't changed much for his stomach issues. We have been to the doctor and had a bunch of tests run and everything is coming back clear. Did you ever figure out what was causing your issues? I am inclined to get him some Acidophilus supplements since that seemed to help a few people on here. I am curious as to how this ended up for you and if there was anything else that helped you out.

"Hello Dave,
I am sorry to read that your son is suffering. As I am sure you have gathered from this thread and simular ones the problem is the symptoms we all seem to have literally could be caused by a list of things This is why it is so hard to diagnose!
All you can do is try!
things I have tried;
- Acidiphilus tablets (2 a day) from Holland and Barrat or Onken Natural Yogurt (table spoon morning, lunch & night)
(do not do both of the above but one or the other is the same, basically it is to put ""good bacteria"" back into the gut as there may be an imbalance
- Kept a food diary to see if it was food related
- Went on a wheat and gluten free diet for a month
- Endoscopy, Colonoscopy, Stool Samples, Ultra sound, blood tests
- Cut out fizzy drinks
I recommend you try the above (on seperate occassions) to see if any of them help.
One common cause to these syptoms could be H.Pylori ask the doc to test him for that - its a simple stool sample they send away - easy to test for and least you can rule that out straight away.
Good luck

"Jenny you have described my symptoms to a tee. In 2009 after my son was born I had my first bout with stomach pain. It was so bad I fell onto the floor and laid there wondering if my appendix had ruptured. The pain is so severe at times it affects my ability to walk, I’m hunched over and I feel like my shoulder is being dragged down. I have also had numerous tests done, endoscopy, colonoscopy, blood work, u/s, ct scan, you name it, nothing, all clear. I modified my diet to remove gluten, worked like a charm for awhile then the pain was back. I cut out soft drinks. Worked for awhile then the pain was back.. I’m at my wit’s end.
I noticed that the pain typically coincides with a certain week in my monthly cycle, week 3. I did a little research and week 3 (and sometimes as far back as week 2) having something to do with ovulation can have an effect on digestion by slowing it down. Because my stomach pains truly feel like I’ve been blown up like a balloon and my insides are tender and sore and full of sharp rocks, I really think it might be an issue of slow digestion during certain periods of the month brought upon by certain hormonal or environmental changes.
Solution? God knows. I have an appointment with my gyno to discuss but have very low expectations. What is he to do? Shut down my hormones? Not likely. F-ing hormones are responsible for all the troubles in the world I tell ya.

"Hello Anne,
Thank you very much for your above post, very interesting thought.
To be honest with me it was happening on a daily basis so I don't this is the case, however over the last couple of months, my sypthoms aren't daily (WHAT A RELIEF!!!) however they are still occuring.
I am now monitoring when the flare ups are happening as you say the thought has crossed my mind if it could be related to my monthly's.
I had been on the contreceptive pill for approximately 16 years and as a process of illimination I came off this back in February - I believe it takes 6 months for this to completey get out of your system, so could this of been the course of my daily symptoms? possibly, however I have tried numerous things so could be any.
As I say unfortunately I am still not recoved as I am still getting flare ups, and still have a regular upset stomach however I am just so relieved the daily HELL is currently not the case.
Thank you again for your comments and I sincerley hope you get to the bottom of your problems quickly!

"Hi Jenny
I was diognosed with Gastritis 4 years ago now. I can generally manage my flare ups now but this has taken me all this time to get there. I still have my bad days (today for one as I was sick in the night last night and I am now in agony) I know how you feel it is extremely upsetting as the pain is so awful.
I have been taking lanoperazole now on a regular basis for a while. At first like you say it did nothing, but now I take one a day in the morning and this normally sets me up ok. However alongside taking my tablets I have had to extremely manage my diet, cutting out alcohol (for me one of the worst triggers) spicy foods, less breads and pasta, no fizzy drinks, some fruit juices, lots of fruit.
I am in a place now where it is more manable but unfortunately this is something I have for life so I have to learn to work around it in order to keep away from the pain and upset it causes. I hope you can learn to control yours more as I remember being in your shoes. Also I did notice that taking probiotics helped me significantly as they help to manage the bacteria in your stomach.

"Hello Emma
Thank you very much for your comment above and I really am happy that your able to control your flare ups, as you say they are sooooo painful its untrue and unless you have experienced it i don't think you can understand.
It helps that you have had a diognosis! How did they come to the conclusion that it was gastritus?
Unfortunately i had numerous tests and still undiagnosed, I know mine wasn't / isn't gastritus as I had an endoscopy which it would of shown up then!
However my daily pain has currently reduced into weekly which even though it isn't nice, its a HUGE releif not to have that daily cloud over my head.
I know one day i will get to the bottom of it and be cured, i am determind! just all takes time.

"Hi Jenny,
Thank you for keeping this thread alive for a long time.. I will say that I've had just about all the same experiences and issues with my stomach as alot of people who have posted here. I had this pain for many years (possibly 10 years) at the time up until about 2009 when I figured out what was going on, it didn't start off too bad but it got progressively worse over the years to the point where it was unbearable at times. Here's my story that might help some:
I've been overweight for most of my life to the point where I believe I am considered 'obese' - strike 1. I also smoked occassionally (a pack a week) - strike 2 and I also drank on weekends probably more than I should have - strike 3. I tried all the stomach medicines and they really didn't help, I started eating bland foods and that helped a little but didn't make the problem any better.
When I went to a Gastroenterologist early in the 2000's he diagnosed me with Gastritis but my blood results were a little off. I went through dozens of tests and was eventually diagnosed with Fatty Liver which meant 1 of 2 things - I was overweight (clearly I was) OR it could be the onset of Liver disease. Because of my age at the time it was more likely to be my weight than Liver disease so 'I was cleared', at least in my mind and I was less worried about my stomach pain because it wasn't as bad early on.
A few years go by and my stomach is worse - I had been going back to the Dr. but he kept insisting that I lose weight before doing a biopsy - I would lose a little weight and it would show improvement but he couldn't clear me for sure.
Then one day I found out that my cousin needed a liver transplant (death was around the corner as she kept is a secret) so as any relative would do I went to the doctor to see if I was an eligible donor - I don't remember if they said I wasn't eligible because I was overweight or because of the fatty liver but it was upsetting to say the least.
I used this as a catalyst to change my lifestyle, I can tell you with 100% certainty giving up smoking, losing 80lb's (enough where I was still overweight but not obese) and scaling back my drinking was the end all cure all.. I went back to a new doctor when I moved to a different house and had a perfect physical and never a stomach problem in the 2 years since I change my habbits.
Unfortunately I've gained alot of weight back, started smoking occasionally again and enjoy myself in a few drinks on the weekend and now my stomach probems are back - possibly with a vengeance which is why I'm searching onling again for any remedies that I can find. There are other causes to stomach problems - stress, being out of shape, the list goes on but I believe 90% of chronic stomach problems can be controlled with lifestyle changes.. I know for myself I have to live with my stomach issues until I bring back my good habbits.. it's not an unknown to me, it's reality that I accept.
If I didn't experience the pain and then the cure of the pain there is no way anyone would have convinced me that my bad habbits at the time were causing my issues. Those 4 cigarettes that you're having a day would put me in bed with so much pain. For someone else it might be the tea or the coffee, being overweight, alcohol consumption, too much food, spicy food or a combination of these things. Until you give up everything that your doctors says to give up then you are consciously making a choice to live with this pain.

"Hello Brendan,
Thank you for your message, and yes you are right the one thing that I haven't removed from my diet and tried is to give up the 4 cigarettes I smoke a day, however I am set to give up in the coming months.
As I am sure you can appreciate it is a chicken or the egg situation, being in such pain causes a huge amount on stress and depression, especially living with this hell for over a year, giving up smoking was the last thing i could bring my self to do! However I am definately going to give it ago, as you say you never know!
Good luck with your battle, I hope all is well with you.

"Hi All
I know this may be very late for some of you but I suffered for years with bad pains to my stomach and eventually my imune system was effected. This was after 8 - 10years of various problems numerous tests and treatments.
I descovered I had an alergy to YEAST not wheat. This, I was told by a professional is extreemly rare and told me I was would not be. I then took a blind food test and sure enough the results were positive I was alergic to YEAST. It is in many foods and the reaction is made worse with sugar taken near the same time. One intake of yeast can cause pain for over two weeks and can react to a wide range of foods.
I take ceterizine found in hayfever tablets if I feel any pain coming on and this helps relieve the swelling and pain. If I do not catch it quick enough the pain can go on much longer. Slippery elm has always helped but not prevented or made it go totally away. I have cut YEAST out of my diet all together in the last 5 years and this has been brilliant - I had forgoten what feeling well was.
This is overlooked by so many people but I think it is much more common than we know. Yeast is in bread, beer, lager, wine etc but is is in many foods as a preservative.
I discovered my food alergy because my mother in law was a chief and took my diet right back to veg only then added this and we recorded my reaction. I took me a long time to convince the doctors to test me but after years of problems and months of me telling them it was food they tested me. Then after having this confirmed by the local hospital I am now much better as long as I whatch what I eat.
I hope you all make some progress as I am only too awear of how debilitating, depressing and upsetting it can be.

Keep a food diary as well as helps you keep track on what you eat and when you get flare ups!

"Hi guys,
I stumbled upon your thread whilst trying to research my illness a bit more.
im sorry to hear that you are all suffering, but if it helps I understand, I also understand the frustration.
my problems began 3 years ago. I have the agonising pain, severe acid, (this got so bad it actually burnt a layer if skin off my tongue), I hadn't had a solid poo in over 2 years, was vomiting and pooping blood, lethargic all of the time and was in a state of confusion 70% of the time. I was eventually sent to a specialist who was convinced I had crohns. I had the endoscopy and colonoscopy and they found that I had chronic gastritis and diverticulitis. I was put on omeprazole, but to no avail, I am now on pantoprazole and find that the side effects are awful!!
I am visiting the doctor again this week. Just feel so frustrated, people who do not experience this have no idea just how much it impacts on every day life!
So fed up!

Thank you for your message, and yes you are 100% right, unless your going through what we are no body understands it is like there is a constant black cloud looming over your head doesn't it!
Its the toilet problems that gets me most at the moment if I am honest, having a regular upset stomach and loose stools is really not nice, and worrying! I wonder if it is damaging to have constant upset stomach to your health?
I don't know..... all we can do is keep trying and hope we get to the bottom of it all quickly.
One thing for sure when resolved we will never take feeling ""normal"" for granted EVER AGAIN! I know I certainly won't!
I hope you manage to get some answers soon.

"Have you tried to take digestive enzymes? If you are feeling fullnes it might be gastroparesis where your stomach is not emptying food as fast as a normal person so it just all sit there and the acid sits there as well causing bloating fullness and stomach ulcers. Try eating smaller meals but more often and don't eat any sweet stuff. Maybe try iberogast (I think that is how you spell it) don't eat spicy foods if you haven't done so already.

Upper abdomen dull crampling pain in some cases and in others more severe nauseating pain (especially at night in the early hours of night) which stops me from sleeping, or reading or being able to concentrate on anything at all. I have recently been diagnosed by my doctor as having 'lazy stomach' or otherwise known as gastroparesis. This means that the stomach is not emptying properly and therefore creating pain and discomfort. I don't have any of the other symptoms of vomiting and feeling full after food, but it seems that that this condition can be different for each person. Unfortunately there's no cure for this other than medication to help stimulate the stomach muscle to work properly and changing eating habits. It's a depressing thought that there is no known cure for this. I'm including a website here for you to look at which has helped me enormously and perhaps it will be of help to you too. I can't say that this is what you have, but it certainly sounds exactly the same as my problem.

"Hello Heather,
Thank you very much for posting on my thread. A couple of questins, you say your symptoms are the same as mine, does that include regular upst stomach? Also how did your doctor diagnose youwith ""lazy stomach""?
Yes i feel for you that there is no cure, however least you have received diagnosis whichhopefully has enabled to help you move forward a bit?
The only advice I can give is that there may be no cure, however continue to try new things that might ease your syptoms, one thing that I personally find that helps with mine is pepermint tea. It's mant to be great for your digestive system. I drink two cups a day - whether its helped i can't say however it doesnt do any harm
Thanks again.

"Hi Jenny, I can have stomach pain for several days and then it disappears for anything up to 10 days. Of course, at this point I'm thinking that it's gone, but then slowly but surely I start getting the first rumbles and back it comes. As I said, I had the endoscopy, and ultrasounds and blood tests done and then was referred to a specialist gastroenterologist who confirmed that I had what is known as lazy stomach.
I also found out today that aloe vera either in juice form or gel (both disgusting) is supposed to work really well. Also digestive enzymes, probiotics, apple cider vinegar and gentian. Believe me, I'm going to try them all. I've been on Motilium (domperidone) for about a month now, but it hasn't really done anything at all, except bring my blood pressure right down low and my pulse rate went down to 48 per min! I think I'm going to discontinue the pills and stick to natural products from now on to try and find a way to at least manage the situation. I find the hardest thing is not having anything to take when the stomach cramps set in to try and alleviate the pain - you feel so helpless.
I hope the peppermint tea helps you, but I haven't tried that yet. I've been drinking copious amounts of ginger and chamomile and as you say, none of these herbs can do any harm. I'm even going to give accupuncture a try too. I also believe it's so important not to get stressed and anxious when going through a bad spell - it only axacerbates the symptoms.
Good luck Jenny - it's a hard road, but persevere! I hope we both get the better of this awful condition !
Take care
Cheers,
Heather

"Oh right, interesting, I presume this isn't what i have got as would of thought the gastroenterolgist I saw would of spotted it, however who knows! The problem is with the sypmthoms we suffer it could be sooooo many things! So frustrating!
Oh yes i have heard aloe vera juice/gel is meant to be good for stomachs! Yes I have also taken probiotics, this did help for the first month, however my body must of got used to them so didn't use to make any difference. My chemist gave a good tip regarding probiotics, he said to get ""Onken Natural Yogurt"" as this has millions of live bacteria in (better than tablet form) and to have a tablespoon 3 x a day, again i did find this helped
Yes pepermint tea definately settles the stomach and now im used to the taste i quite enjoy it!
Yes a very true statement not to get stressed and anxious as this only makes it worse (i know from my experience!)
Thanks again for sharing your story, yes we must continue to find an answer ay! One thing is certain, when we do we wont take ""normal"" health for granted again!

"Hi Jenny,
I have an 11 year old daughter. 3 weeks ago she experienced this acute ""stabbing"" ""throbbing"" ""burning"" pain in the top of her stomach right between the ribcage base...and like you also a little to the left. She has been constantly feeling sick, sleeps 18 hours a day, eats and feels bad again. her legs have given way, shortness of breath...every thing you describe. After 3 failed attempts at diagnosis from doctors I ended up at A & E (she is doubled over in agony), the pain has moved and she feels it sometimes all over her stomach in different points. Told it is stomach migraine?! Ever heard of that!? But what HAS helped the pain subside is cutting out wheat...she hasnt had bread this week partly because i havent made her sandwiches as she hasnt been to school, plus I have been giving her proper cooked from scratch meals and no instant foods such as nuggets or pizza etc. Not saying that I always do. She is living on paracetamol. My friends thought she shared symptoms of crohns and also suggested acid reflux but neither of those., Nor appendix. In July she had her first abdominal flare up and then the doctors said it was an infection of the base of her oesophagus... due to the fact she had tonsilitits and as i didnt treat it with antibiotics (she has had 3 courses of antibiotics and this time I tried manuka honey and organic lemon), because i'd left it without 'proper medication' the infection had spread further down (yep! thats what hospital said). The symptoms for this are similar to appendicitis.
Some very good friends of mine run a natural healing group on a social network site and have suggested oregano as a remedy. I will try. I hope you get some resolve out of this. I keep thinking it is diet and probably wheat/dairy intolerance... Good luck xxx

"I think you should also try homeopathy Along with other medication.
I had my share of problems with stomachnpain some 12 yrs back. Doctors made me go through all sorts of diagnosis but nothing came out. I was in constant pain and onw day was suggested to go to a very famous honeopathic doctor. And it worked . It went away in a week. And never came back till last week. As soon as I landed in London it started. every morning I don't feel like going to office but staying in bet even doesnot help. I found a homeopathic doctor here and went to him. Taking the medicine from last 2 DayS. Condition improved but still I have kept my fingers crossed. Let see what happens

"I have just found this so sorry for being a late commer. I have experienced simmilar to what some of you guys have but here's my story. About July 2014 we actually had hot weather here in the UK and I started having a craving for slat water...pints of it and this went on for 2 weeks. Nothing strange I thought as it was hot etc but suddenly and it was like overnight I swapped from salt to sugar! My cravings had change, my stomach was bloated and I was sleeping after dinner solidly for about 4 hrs waking up having a galss of water then sleeping solid for at least 8 hours. I went to see my GP, they did full bloods on me and called me back in the following day and told me I had pernious anemia (B12 deficiency) and very very low iron. The B12 was sorted with injections and now every 3 months for ever. However went to see consultant who was concerned about some ""hard"" patches in my stomach as I had complained about bloating and pains there. An endoscapy and colonoscapy later, consultant said all was well expect that I had an inflamed stomach....Gastritis! Currentl;y taking Lansoprazole 30mg tablets untill 19th December 2014 and have to say feeling loads better. Watching what I eat and of course not on coffee, booze, spicy or oily but also found out that choclate is an irritant! So only drinking tea with sugar but no milk and it really is working for me. I also take them 30 mins before breakfast same time near enough every day but also take an iron tablet with my breakfast. Touch wood all seems to be working well so far other than a bit of dehydration which I sort out with lots of water. Hope some of that helps and wish you luck. Will post again after my next check up which is in mid Jan 2015. Oh and biopsy was taken in stomach and colon although consultant only did this to double check all was clear. Nothing at all to worry about and stomach appears to be settling down.Good luck.

"Hi all, not sure if I'm on the right subject here but just wandering if anybody has it had any similar experiences.....?? I have been having really bad 'knawing' and 'burning' pains in my stomach and constantly feel like going sick (not actually doing so) but the most alarming bit of which im hoping people can help with is, this constant feeling of being 'winded' like there's pressure on or under my ribs it's horrible!! Too it off with feeling tired and fatigued a lot it's a real drain on daily life! Had endoscopy and cystoscopy, mild inlfammation and hiatus hernia diagnosed but ive had those a while and these symptoms are quite sudden and not typical for me. I hope everyone on this discussion has some luck with their ailments! ️Thankyou 😀

I've been throwing up so much lately that I've lost 5 lbs in one week. I'm sick and don't know why. Some say ulcers or H pylori. I go to the doc AGAIN today and I hope I get answers.

"Hello Toni,
So sorry to read your going through simular.
Have you had any tests to date?
I haven't posted much as unfortunately I haven't any update on my situation
My problem has eased considerably since this time last year, as I used to feel ill every day, now its moved to weekly.
How i have managed that i don't know, as I say I am still not right however i have done so many things to try and help my problem it could be any of them!
The only thing that I can think may be causing my flare ups is when I am exhausted, thats when it seems to happen. Throughout all of the problems I have had i have struggled but continued doing my normal routine, work/socialising/running ect. It has been hard and brought m e to tears many times but I just didn't want to give up!
I live a very busy lifestyle and as i say I notice at the moment my flare ups happen when I am at a low.
Good luck on getting better, don't give up on trying to get to the bottom of it! and if i find any answers I will of course update you.

"I wondered if anyone could help me, since about January 2013 I have on and off had a dull ache in my stomach, sometimes flaring up to make me feel sick. I actually put this down to anxiety however in the past few weeks my theory has changed.
About three weeks ago my stomach flared up however to the worst pain I have experienced as yet, made me feel like I was going to be sick constantly and made me not know what to do with myself. I feel like there is a lump in my thought and my stomach feels tender and swollen when flares up feels like my stomach is on fire/knotted up!
The pain was so sever I went to the doctors (2 and a half weeks ago), my doctor felt my stomach and said it felt swollen, I told her the symtoms and she says she thinks I have gastritis and prescribed me with Lansoprazole 30mg tablets to take daily for 1 month, this however to date hasn't helped my stomach at all, the flare up comes and goes however the pain in my stomach is constant and the Lansorprazole is causing terrible upset stomach to the point I am worried to not be near a toilet.
I went back to the doctors on Tuesday 22/10 explained all of the above to her and she said I am to keep taking the tablets and she is happy to see me again in November (once the months course has been taking) however im in dispear with this pain HAD ENOUGH OF FEELING ILL and can't help but think the worse
Has anyone experienced symptoms same as above as I feel extremely on my own shouting and no one understanding what im going though

"Hi there, I've been reading your discussion and just wondered if you ever had an official diagnosis? I'm currently experiencing severe upper and sometimes left side stomach pain coupled with upper back pain. I've been having problems in this area for nearly a year now. I've had a colonoscopy and an endoscopy along with several ultrasounds and various blood test. Gastroenterologist was convinced that I'd had an infection that had caused some damage at the beginning of the year as all tests were clear. I get excruciating churning pain in the upper centre of my stomach just below my ribs and my back. I'm waiting to see the Gastroenterologist again as he thinks this new episode is something different. I really want a ct scan but don't know if I can wait much longer on the nhs. I'm taking pain releif daily and this whole thing seems to be taking over my life.
Any comments or advice would be gratefully received

"Hi choccy, is your pain in the pit of your stomach so to speak? Above your belly button and do you have the constant rib pain under both ribs almost like a constant stitch? I get these symptoms you see along side the back pain and everything points to pancreatitis but also if you go for endoscopy you might find you'll have hiatus hernia which I have and causes acid reflux and gerd condition this has all kinds of implications for the stomach area but can all be controlled with right drugs and diet etc. I'm currently trying every investigative avenue but the pain in stomach and ribs is so uncomfortable it's unreal. Please reply and let me know if you have similar woes. Thanks andy.

"Hi andy - the pain I have is literally under the ribs it is a stitch like/churning that just feels horrendous. I also get a lot of pain to left side of my stomach - almost feels like something is there! Back pain has become intense too - mainly upper back. I'm really worried all the time - my endoscopy was clear back in June but my symptoms have changed so much since then. I've had some bouts of feeling nauseous and diahorrea but these seem to have calmed of recent weeks. Feel like I don't know my own body at the moment. So sorry to hear you are also suffering too - this pain is really the worst. The doctor has given me cocodomol for the pain but I'm not sure it actually helps! Are you taking any medication?

"Hi choccy thanks for the reply. It seems like you do have similar symptoms, how unfortunate! I presume you also have health anxiety like myself which doesnt help matters at all!!! Do you get the stitch pains on both ribs did you say?? Maybe stabbing pains as such too?? I believe rib pain can radiate to the back and vice versa and can each be the cause of each other's pain if you follow me? I take co-drydamol prescribed by doctor for pain and omazropole which is a stomach acid inhibitor which is good for keeping acid reflux at bay and helps heal any potential ulcers which could be the case here, it can affect the rib, stomach and back area so ive read. Ive trawled through many a forum or health site and seen so many variations of these symptoms and ailments and what they could be attributed to it just raises more questions. Could be an underlying gastro condition your suffering with but then it could be cardiovascular and that's where your brain Starts to run amok!!!! I don't find gp helpful at all...my advice is to keep pushing for referrals...ive managed to push to go to see gastrologist before Christmas about some more investigative work (camera through back passage, another endoscopy etc) and a referral to a paediatrician for cardio side of things to get some answers! My advice would be to do the same thing and definetely get another endoscopy because things can change and if it is a stomach or peptic ulcer that's causing these problems then that's the only way you'll find out. Maybe you could just go sit in a and e and say you can't take it no more do they run tests quicker....that's exactly what I'll be doing very soon I think!!

"Hi Andy, thank you for your advice. yes I do I health anxiety which in itself is taking over my life at the present time! Sorry to hear your suffering as much as I am. My GP laughingly thinks I'm depressed - the only thing depressing me is being in constant pain! I did end up in A&E about a month ago. To be honest it was a waste of time as they pumped me full of pain relief and I was so out of it. They did redo my ultrasound and bloods etc which were all clear and then told me to contact my consultant. I do feel this whole thing is becoming a battle - I think I will push for repeat tests as I know feeling like this cannot be normal. Glad to hear you've managedd to get an appointment with your consultant before Christmas. Hope you get some answers - keep me posted

"Hello Choccy,
I'm so sorry to hear your suffering similar symptoms to me, it's awful
Unfortunately to date I have had a diagnosis, however my symptoms have improved considerably in the last year, I get flare ups weekly now rather than daily!
unfortunately the symptoms we experience could mean we have a huge number of different problems, which is why it is a long process of different tests to go thru (process of illimination)
Have u been tested for h pylori? Something simple the docs can test u for (stool sample) you symptoms are the same as that, also have u tried keeping a food diary? And stripping ur diet back to plain foods to see if that makes a difference? These are things u can do rAther than relying on doctors!
Good luck I hope u find the answer soon

Thank you - I do hope I get some answers soon too. I have had a stool test and that was ok which is good but frustrating at the same time! I'm now going down the diet route while waiting to see the consultant - I just want to enjoy Christmas without being too uncomfortable.
Strange as it sounds it's reassuring to know that you haven't had a definite diagnosis either as I do feel like I'm going mad at times.
Can I just ask - do you have any back pain? I seem to be suffering with that lately too 😞 glad to here your symptoms have improved though - there's hope!!

"Yes I completely understand, after all the tests I had that come back all clear I was relieved but disappointed at the same time as u just want to know what's wrong!!!
I only experienced back pain a few times, mone is just severe upper stomach pain/swelling which would also spread to my lower stomach and diarea daily (several times a day)
Glad to hear ur already changing up ur diet, I also stopped taking any tablets (I never take nurofen anymore as this is hard on ur tummy), I only take paracetamol very occasionally now if I have a migraine I can't shift. I stopped my contraceptive pill all vitamin tablets I was taking too (just in case!)
I don't drink fizzy drinks anymore either.
A good thing I would recommend is Onken natural yogurt, tablespoon breakfast lunch and dinner time, it's full of live ""good"" bacteria (inc acidophilus) - my chemist that is fantastic and knows his stuff recommended it to my. Basically u could have a imbalance of bad bacteria in ur gut and this will give it a helping hand to bring it back to how it should just the one u buy from the supermarket
Another thing I also suffer from anxiety , this really does not help our condition, as the mind is extremely powerful and likely to be making u worse. I saw a councillor thru the nhs, this really helped and I took away lots of technics which got me/gets me thru it

"Hi jenny,
im sorry to read all your posts but it is as if I wrote them. I'm 28 years old and have been suffering with the same issues for at lease 10 years. However they have been worse in the last 5. My stomach swells up, firstly right at the top at the break of my ribs, it then progresses southward to the bottom left where my intestines and Dillon are. I feel a massive pressure build up which can be relieved by the horrific farting (sorry passing wind) . Which one is bad enough in itself but try explaining to others farting actually hurts. Sometimes I feel a massive burst inside like an I interafart which is strange but once it's happened then pain subsides, but before it kills like mad.
What differes slightly for me is the pain is always worse at night. I often wake up with it have to dash to the toilet and I'm either presented with diarroheah or projectile vomiting, or if I'm lucky both. This goes on for a few hour until I either pass out from the pain on the bathroom floor or it calms down and i finally fall asleep completely exhausted.
I've been to so many doctors and specialist, had all the test mentioned above even, all came back fine and I also got branded with the IBS brush. I cannot see how this is IBS, during the worst moments I actually feel like I can't take the painany more and they come on in waves a bit like contractions. at the time I start dripping with sweat and can barely move, other than to cry etc.
I've tried keeping food diaries etc no regular patterns, other than alcohol and curry seem to sometime make things worse but again it's not consistently.. I did notice it was always worse around my period, so I took these new findings to the doctor who then scanned my lady parts . But again all fine. They scanned my stomach said I was ver conjested so gave my heavy suppositories which were suppose to make you go within 20 mins. They didn't, and nothing else was followed up about that. Something i can go a whole month without passing an stole. This is crazy and my doctors response was I'm just dehydrated. I realise they were not taking me seriously even if it cried my eyes out at the doctors. If I search I line. Literally scare myself to dead and think I have colon/ intestine cancer!
Now I'm a physical education teacher in the uk so I have a very busy active lifestyle and a stressful job working with teenagers . Again if it was just dhydration, surely Id dead now after 10 years of It!
Like the previous posts from other when I feel a slights pain I take a buscapan tablet this can prevent big attacks but only reduces them. Once the pain is at its worse they do nothing. The only thing tha came backs no hen tests my nitrate levels very very low but again they dont know !!
I feel completely fed up with the searching for answers and how all these doctors make me feel like it's nothing. Whenever I get one step closer I take 2 back. I scared to be away from the toilet in case an attack comes on especially if I was a school.this has made me very anxious and unhappy to go out and lead a normal life. Ive a very active person and eat fairly healthy minus my university years. I hope you find some a swears to as I known own to feel to be brushed aside. The worse thing is if I have a days off sick due To this, IBS does not seem a valid reason but this is not IBS!
Any further info you know no outs wuld be great, and I hopes of find answers to.
Before i go one random thing that helped me before and I still use it at times is drinking a glass of salt water, random I know but can help sometimes however nasty that is.
Thanks for posting, reading your other messages has at leaste made me feel Saine and able to keep trying to fined answers.

"Hey Jenny if you don't mind me asking how is your diet? There could be a traffic jam in your intestines. You might not produce enough enzymes to break down the food. You mentioned you lived a very fast lifestyle so Im assuming you eat a lot of proccessed food.Right now I'm taking an enzyme supplement which helped tremendously. I still feel ehh but not as much as before. I suggest you try it. You can buy it from GNC.

"HI All; so many comments ; it's hard to read them all so apologies if this has been covered.
The solution may be:
1. Take Milk Thistle to improve the function of your liver which affects the gallbladder and then the bowel. (right side abdominal pain just under rib cage and or pain across your sternum - where the liver is)
2. Take a liquorice tablet to kill bad bacteria (kills h pylori) [cranberries together with oregano inhibit h pylori) and also a pro-biotic/ yoghurt.. also reduces issues with gallbladder /bile reducing acid.. (if that is the right way to say it)
3. Tak anti Inflammatories like GARLIC - (also antioxidant) or Turmeric.
4. Take a vitamin tablet; if you have right sided pain below your rib cage; you may want to consider taking a liverhealth vitamin tablet.
Imrpove your diet; by including anti-oxidantfoods(like red grapes/onions/ beetroot etc) and do ensure you take anti-inflammatories regularly as inflammation can increase risks of cellular change.
I hope this information is helpful adn woudl very much appreciate feedback as it assists others who are unwell to know whether this is working. it worked for me; liver/gallbladder and bowel/ stomach issues.. and it's do'able.
Thanks to God and Jesus and a helpful christian who was in a wheelchair whose name was SARAH ..
i also had a makeover in my diet plan; if you have difficulty digesting fats; look at your liver.
I had suffered for 7 years; right sided abdominal pain (under ribcage)and pain in my middle stomach.. started off with a food intolerances, one thing here, then during the course of the 7 years escalted from pain under the right rib cage intermittently to full blown pain to distension; and the list goes on! coudn't eat food without pain. i wont' go on. The issue was bad bacteria (perhaps h pylori) and inflammation and liver and gallbladder issues.

"i forgot to mentio that reducing yoru caffeine and alcohol intake (alcohol is a toxin to the body).. is one of the things you should also consider!!!
Inflammation of hte liver is Heptatitis; and it is not being diagnosed (or patients are not being told) ; so best to look after your liver..

"another thing i forgot to say; it is early so apologies; is for ANYONE taking ANY type of medication - Please include Anti-oxidant foodstuffs and probiotics in your diet to promote the removal of waste/ toxic substances; assisting your liver; because you will find a lot of people develop liver issues and toxic bulid up (fatty foodstuffs/ nsaids etc) which can then manifest in yellow creamy patches on your eyes (sclera).. and this is indicative of liver and gallbladder issues.. so pain meds can make the situation WORSE for your liver that is ALREADY struggling with 'stuff' like fats, alcohol, caffeine etc.. (please look up fatty liver)..

"I wondered if anyone could help me, since about January 2013 I have on and off had a dull ache in my stomach, sometimes flaring up to make me feel sick. I actually put this down to anxiety however in the past few weeks my theory has changed.
About three weeks ago my stomach flared up however to the worst pain I have experienced as yet, made me feel like I was going to be sick constantly and made me not know what to do with myself. I feel like there is a lump in my thought and my stomach feels tender and swollen when flares up feels like my stomach is on fire/knotted up!
The pain was so sever I went to the doctors (2 and a half weeks ago), my doctor felt my stomach and said it felt swollen, I told her the symtoms and she says she thinks I have gastritis and prescribed me with Lansoprazole 30mg tablets to take daily for 1 month, this however to date hasn't helped my stomach at all, the flare up comes and goes however the pain in my stomach is constant and the Lansorprazole is causing terrible upset stomach to the point I am worried to not be near a toilet.
I went back to the doctors on Tuesday 22/10 explained all of the above to her and she said I am to keep taking the tablets and she is happy to see me again in November (once the months course has been taking) however im in dispear with this pain HAD ENOUGH OF FEELING ILL and can't help but think the worse
Has anyone experienced symptoms same as above as I feel extremely on my own shouting and no one understanding what im going though

"I have had almost the exact same pain your describing. It started in June and I went to go to a party and I had one drink but the pain would just kill my stomach. It felt like it would cramp so bad to the point where I was going to be sick. The same thing would happen after eating. I went to the doctor and he said it sounded like gastritis. I was on medicine but didn't work. Finally we went on holidays and the pain was to the point I couldn't stand it. They prescribed me lansaprazol as well and that seemed to help for a while. However the doctors thought I had an ulcer but the ultrasound came back fine. I went back to my doctor and she prescribed me perriette and said my stomach lining was inflamed. I find perriette is working but I still have to watch what I eat/drink. I can't have much alcahol because that will make me extremely sick. I can't have much acidic drinks like even orange juice in the morning. I too have anxiety pretty bad and social anxiety. So if I get super nervous when my stomach hurts I find if I can calm down and relax my stomach that helps too. Anyways I hope this helped.

"Hi there,
Im so happy that other people are going through the same thing. I have had stomach pains for a year and a half now. It seems to be constant but fluctuates in pain serverity sometimes it comes on so quick and is unbearable. I have missed countless days at work or uni and i feel like i cant go anywhere for the fear of feeling rough. I have had blood tests, endoscopy, colonoscopy, ultrasound, had tablets for ibs and cut out various foods from my diet but nothing seems to help. The doctors have given up on me and put it down to depression so i am on clitalopram. However i think the depression is more an effect of the pain rather than the cause. Im at my wits end and dont know what to do anymore.

"Hi, Jenny. I have had the same thing going on with me for a few years now. It's always on my right side though..in my rib cage area. The flare ups normally only happen once or twice a month but they last for 2-3 days at a time. The flare ups normally start with me eat something. The only way I can make myself feel better is to get the food off my my stomach and even then the pain does not completely go away. For 2-3 days I pretty much do not eat anything and if I do I have to make it come back up. The pain is awful. I have been to the ER about this seeing as I do not have insurance but the doctors here do not take me seriously. I told them what was going on. They did not even do any tests. They just said you have GERD. To this day I still do not think I have GERD. I too have had luck with Aloe vera, but it didn't work all the time for me. I bought some aloe vera juice(which isn't very good btw) and just drink it when I would have a flare up. Sadly the people I live with threw it away when they were ""cleaning out the fridge"" I think stress could have a little to do with it, but I also know there is more to it than that. Hopefully one day I will find out.

"Jenny, thank you so much for sharing your journey with your stomach ache with us. As I was reading your story, I honestly felt like as though you were talking about me and what I go through day to day basis since 2008. I am exhausted and don't know what other avenue to take in order to control this dull achy pain in my stomach. I was told I have gastritis and nothing else. I have done the endoscopy/ultrasound/CT Scan tests and they all came back normal except for having gastritis. I have taken different medications for it and non of it worked for me. I am a busy mother is taking control over me and the things I do with my babies. Please let me know if there is anything new that has worked for you as of today. Looking forward to hearing from you.

"Hi Jenny,
A google search for my symptoms turned up your discussion. How are you feeling now? I had ongoing abdominal pain for over 10 years and a whole battery of tests which proved negative. I tried diet and naturopaths which helped a little. It finally turned out to be a ""grumbling appendix"", diagnosed by CT scan which I had not had previously, which then became acute. I was initially treated with IV antibiotics which didn't work and then had my appendix removed (luckily just in time!). Post-op infection was not much fun.
That was two and a half years ago. Just recently I started feeling queasy and bloated and woke in the middle of the night with a sharp stabbing pain in my central abdomen radiating through to my back. Well, it can't be my appendix, it's gone. Doctor has ordered blood tests for H. pylori, enzyme and CRP levels, etc. He thinks it could be gastritis, but will wait and see. I am finding I can't each much at all. I am still getting recurring bouts of pain. I hope all will be OK as we are going on a big overseas trip soon.
Diet does make a big difference, though. A theory is the modified wheat most of us eat nowadays, which is very different to that eaten by previous generations, causes all kinds of health issues. I tried spelt flour, which is more easily digested.
I have been taking ibuprofen as I have lower disc trouble. I am now told to switch to paracetamol. I also like beer and wine so should cut it down or out.
Pro-biotics or digestive enzyme supplements may also be worth trying. I am not having them right now but may go back to them if latest tests prove inconclusive.

"My daughter has all the same symptoms like you. It started in Early February when she caught a stomach bug, took her 2 weeks but she got better. A month later she got vaccinated with the Gardasil vaccine and all the stomach problems came back 2 weeks after the vaccine. so far we had blood tests and an ultrasound that came back negative, and we are now awaiting the results of a H.Pylori blood test. she was put on Tecta which did absolutely nothing Her Dr. is now telling us that all the symptoms are psychological!!! I think the vaccine compromised her immune system hence why the problem is here! She has pain that is more severe in the morning like she got punched or stabbed, vomiting, fatique, dizziness, skin tingling.breathlessness weakness, sore muscles weightloss.. it is a very frustrating thing to watch your normally active child turn into a listless person in constant pain. I will try the aloe vera and high probiotic and see if it will help.

"Hello, Jenny, My name is Doreen from the us and I literally cryed readin each & every one of your posts. I'm going through the exact stomach pains as you & some of the others here. Gone through the exact test with the exact results. Absolutely no findings to any of the tests, endoscopy, ct scans ect. All I do is cry & cry as no one understands or even cares to try to understand. I eat every 4 hours which consists of crackers or animal cookies or timy pieces of cooked unseasoned steak with a glass of milk. These meals are ate religiously as I can't eat anything else as I feel sick comstantly. I'm at the point to where I'm on the phone with suicide prevention often. They now know me well as I have other problems as well. I was lucky enoug to stumble upon your page which made me feel I was not alone. I thought this was severe stress as my husband lost his job a few months ago from a very good income to unemployment. Then thought it was meds I was taken as I'm on a lot of vicoden for severe pain as I need. hip fusions on both hips & can barely walk anymore. I was told the cause was of neither problem. Now I have no insurance & look on the web for any help. The only thing different in our case is that I do bring up saliva & feel I need to throw up a lot. With eating very little there is not much of anything to bring up. I'm thinking of trying the alo vera. Have you tryed this yet? Thank you for your support to many on here & keeping us informed. I hope we can get some help soon. Would love to hear from you.

"hi jenny my name is shamika and i have suffered from stomache pain for years sometimes the pain is very unbarable and no matter how many times i went to the emergency room or saw my phasician they could not do anything but prescribe me omeprazole or nexium for acid reflux and heartburn which was their assumption but after living with this pain for months i did not want to hear about no more excuses and what they think it is so they ordered me scope into my stomache and upper abdomen and i got my results 3 days later which came back that i had an bacteria called h-phylori which could lead to an ulcer if it was not tooken care of so they gave me antibiotics which was a 7 day treatment and aslmost the second day i was feeling better but even though i felt better i had to finish the treatment in which i did and have not felt that pain in a year or so intill last year because this bacteria can return even though im on a acid reducer for heartburn and acid reflux i can tell the pain has returned and lately my stomache doctor has been saying just continue to take the omeprozole you will feel better and i dont feel better i'm tired of the pain i tell him i know the h-phylori has returned they put a scope in me again and he said he see's alot of acid buildup and just alittle of the h-phylori bacteria yet they wont give me the anti biotics for the bacteria because he claims its a minor case of the h-phylori bacteria doesn't matter the minor bacteria can be turned into the major bacteria so make sure if you ever feel this pain again you immediately let them know you want to be checked again for this bacteria and it needs to be taken care of

"I know this is an old thread but I do suggest, especially to those of you who went on vacation and then came down with symptons, to get tested for giardia. It's a microscopic parasite and really hard to diagnose b/c you might not find it in the 1st stool sample you do. I was having reocurring stomach problems and reflux that would come and go and cause me to miss work but since I had had a friend who had gone to the same country as me and was diagnosed with giardia while in that country, I kept insisting to the doctor that I had giardia. The first doctor first prescribed nexium and didn't find anything in the stool samples. Then I moved and tried another doctor and he ran all the tests first before prescribing anything and did find the giardia. It took a lot of medication on a very strict schedule to get rid of it but it did cure me. Good luck!!

"Hello. I see that your posts were put up a year ago, but wondering how you are doing. I am having stomach problems also. I have had a sensitive stomach since I was 16 (I'm 50 now) and do not drink alcohol or anything with caffeine in it or anything carbonated. I always drink water. I don't smoke, stay away from acidic foods and spicy things. I have the head of my bed raised and I don't lay down for at least 3 hours after I eat. Still, I have problems! I had an endoscopy and have reflux and gastritis. I can't eat very much at a time without feeling EXTREMELY full and then gnawing cramping pain. I have lost a lot of weight and am depressed. I find myself being envious of everyone who can eat and drink whatever they want. I just want my life back because it seems that this stomach issue has taken over. I think about it constantly. If my stomach feels better, I find myself worried about when it will start to act up again. My daughter is getting married in October and I am so worried that I will not feel well on her special day. Have you gotten any relief and if so, what finally worked? Thanks!!!

"I have recently spent a week in Hospital due to Acute Gastritis.
I feel for you as the pain i had was worse than previous pains i have had with Gall Stones and Kidney Stones.
Three years ago i had a Gastric Sleeve but did not realise the effect Alchohol can have with this particular operation. I now find myself with permanent pains albeit dampened with medication until the Surgeons decide what can be done as a long term cure.I have done a bit of research and it is not unknown for them to remove the Stomach and perform a full bypass.
I hope you can find a long term cure for your problems.

"Hi,
Everyone with stomach pain and bouts of nausea. I have suffered similar symptoms for 15 years, after a surf trip to Indonesia.
At the end of last year I had a pathology test done on a stool and found I had a gut parasite called Blastocystis hominis. Many of the population actually have the parasite but not everyone becomes symptomatic. People are often initially infected if the travel to Asia.
Anyway, if you get a test done and find you have Blasto your doctor will probably be unsure how it is treated. Don’t bother with any usual frontline drug treatments, they have a limited impact.
They recommend an excellent triple drug therapy. I took the drugs, retested and the result was negative. I was feeling great.
The only problem is that, no matter how good your hygiene is, you are likely to have infected some or all of your immediate family. My family have all tested positive! However they cannot be treated as they are not showing symptoms.
Worse still, they must have reinfected me as I started feeling ill again, stomach cramps and slight nausea. I have been tested positive again! It’s a bit of a nightmare.
Actually the whole family is now taking very slight amounts of Sulphur (one pinch mixed in honey once a week). Sulphur is a long forgotten (still used for horses) natural anti-parasitic. I think it might be having a positive impact but I’m not clear of blasto yet.
Good luck. Everyone.

"Hi there,
I found this topic while googling my own very similar symptoms and was wondering how you've been getting on?
I've finally found a career I really enjoy and am now suffering continous stomach pain / bouts of running to the bathroom after eating with no end in sight.
I've been to the GP and had blood / foecal tests. Both seem to be showing up nothing. I've had stomach pains all throughout life and been testing for things like IBD, coeliac etc. I follow a gluten / wheat free diet and don't have an unhealthy lifestyle. It seems they have no answer at all and just put it down to IBS which I feel is a cop out.
No IBS medications seem to work for me, and it's just getting me down. I've been referred back to Gastro but its taking a long time for my appointment. I'm just wondering if you've got any answers as I currently follow a gluten / wheat free diet, avoid dairy, am only eating white chicken and rice and sustaining myself on sips of lucozade.

"Hello! I would suggest you seeing the doctor if it doesn't get better. Did something bring on this pain? I drank heavily one night and since I had pain. It has subsided and gotten a lot better since then. I have been taking dexilant (protein pump inhibitor) every morning. This seems to help the most. I also would take 2 tablespoons of gaviscon when I had symptoms ... So multiple times a day until the pain was gone. I would try and take it a little before I ate because when I ate it caused the worst pain. I avoided alcohol, coffee, deep fried foods. Even now I find if I drink coffee each day I'm not so comfortable so I try and drink green tea... This has less caffeine. When I had the consistent pain however I only drank camomile tea, this is decaffinated ... I think once you get a diagnosis from the doctor it'll help you determine what will help you. I was diagnosed with gastritis though when I was in severe pain I would question it... I still sometimes don't feel comfortable but am almost 100% better! I hope you find a solution to your pain I know how stressful it is!!!

When it hurts,it will last hours ,sometimes over 24 hrs like recently.I do need to go to the doctor but feel they won't know the problem, like everyone else. I've been trying to watch what I eat,and drink. Been drinking cranapple and grape juice,which is easier on my stomach. And trying to stay away from fried or spicy foods,which I love.

"Hi jenny33426! I know exactly how you feel. I was having same symptoms for a long time and went to the E.R.a couple weeks ago.I was expecting them to just say it was an ulser or something and send me on my way,but unfortunately, they didn't. They told me I had stones in my gal bladder and needed to have it removed ,after they gave me a C.A.T. scan of coarse. Which after the surgery and 30 stones they recovered from it later,I'm am doing so much better. I also had to have another procedure to remove a huge stone in my bile duct,which was causing me to look like I had yellow meningitis. And now happy to say after a week in the hospital, I am doing great! Hope this helps you.

"Reading what you have written is like a mirror image of what I'm going through and probably 10 mins of eating a meal I'm buckled up with stomach cramps and don't know where to turn next, I was told I had mild gastritis but now wonder if there is something wrong on the outer stomach?

"Oh my word . I had a severe attack yesterday . It started night before last and lasted into the day yesterday . I was very sick and was feeling like I wanted to die . I vomited at least 20 times and my stomach was swollen to no extent . I ended up in the ER and they made me sit in the ER from the time I arrived at 12: 20 until 8:45 when they finally called me to the back . I was extremely wore out and in severe pain . All they did was an IV and a pain shot and sent me home . Today I'm very sore frm vomiting and my stomach is still very swollen and tender . I need any advice I can get to get this under control . Please help me ....

"Hi Jenny,
I was piosoned with Isopropyl Alcohol gradually in a month period. I did not know it is absorbed very fast through skin. It evantually saturated my liver and I developed the symptoms of a piosoned person. Stomach pain was one of them and after a while it is still there due to the damage Isopropy alcohol has caused to my stomach and the intestine lining and other organs. The piosoning in my case was pretty quick ( a month) but some people get piosoned over a longer time perid by being exposed to poison through usual cleaning liquids used at home or other chamicals.
So verify if you have been and still exposed regularly to a small quantity of harmful chemicals used at home or work environmrnt.

"I wondered if anyone could help me, since about January 2013 I have on and off had a dull ache in my stomach, sometimes flaring up to make me feel sick. I actually put this down to anxiety however in the past few weeks my theory has changed.
About three weeks ago my stomach flared up however to the worst pain I have experienced as yet, made me feel like I was going to be sick constantly and made me not know what to do with myself. I feel like there is a lump in my thought and my stomach feels tender and swollen when flares up feels like my stomach is on fire/knotted up!
The pain was so sever I went to the doctors (2 and a half weeks ago), my doctor felt my stomach and said it felt swollen, I told her the symtoms and she says she thinks I have gastritis and prescribed me with Lansoprazole 30mg tablets to take daily for 1 month, this however to date hasn't helped my stomach at all, the flare up comes and goes however the pain in my stomach is constant and the Lansorprazole is causing terrible upset stomach to the point I am worried to not be near a toilet.
I went back to the doctors on Tuesday 22/10 explained all of the above to her and she said I am to keep taking the tablets and she is happy to see me again in November (once the months course has been taking) however im in dispear with this pain HAD ENOUGH OF FEELING ILL and can't help but think the worse
Has anyone experienced symptoms same as above as I feel extremely on my own shouting and no one understanding what im going though

"I know this is an old post but I've been going thru these symptoms for over a year now. I have bouts of pain after eating, drinking and at times when my stomach is empty....so pretty much constant. I have been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis whic is under control and gastritis, gerd, and small hiatal hernia. My doctor said the hernia shouldn't be causing the problem so that leaves me with the gerd and gastritis. I am taking a high dose of Prilosec ttwice a day and Carafate.i don't drink, smoke, or eat acidic or spicy food. The only things I drink are water or almond milk.i don't know what else to do. I know that for me coffee, chocolate, and peppermint ate definite no-nos. right now I am havivivg pretty bad pains but I'm hoping the Carafate stops it. It usually takes about a week for it to kick in. My doctor wants me to take all that is basically Prilosec with bicarbonate added. They are expensive so I may try to just add a little bicarbonate soda when I take my Prilosec. When having the pain, the only thing I can eat is plain rice, baked chicken, and white potatoes. Stomach still has pain but could be worse. My gall bladder was removed 2 years ago and I believe my problem may be from bile in my stomach and not just regular acid. I will probably call my doc in a few days. He told me if it didn't get better he wanted to do a CAT scan. Not sure why as I think another endoscopy is what I need. I may try aloe juice. Will repost if I do.

"You may want to have your gal bladder checked. I recently (3mths ago) had severe pains in my stomach which was unbearable. A lot of the time it would come about at night when trying to sleep. Or even eating or drinking anything. I always ended up vomiting from the pain.But I finally went to the E.R. one night and they ran a CT/CAT scan on my stomach. My gal bladder was severely twice the size it should have been. I HAD GAL STONES!! It was making my liver sick as well and I was turning yellowish,like jondice.Thankfully I have no more worries after undergoing surgery to remove my gal bladder and all the stones.I am happy to say I have no more pain. ..hope this helps you all in any way. God Bless!

"Hi Jenny, I am glad you started this discussion. It seems many have the same symptoms. I have it too, all of it, the pain, sometimes nauzea, at times feels like a bruised stomach, pain got so intense once I thought I was having a heart attack. I have had many tests as well. Many medications have been tried and not succeeded. It seems the Aloe Vera is the most common treatment among all here, I will try it. Anything is worth a try. I too am tired of the pain. I have lost much weight (45 lbs.) without trying and am still losing. I have other medical problems including ulcerative colitis and asthma and arthritis. I am 54. Perhaps there were no recent responses but I am wondering how you are doing now? Have you found anything that works? Warm water seems to work for a short period of time, relieves the pain. Nothing else works except, of course, not eating. Any food (although I eat very little and nothing to irritate stomach) still hurts my stomach. The Dr's are not God and obviously do their best but sometimes do not find answers. These conversations are good, perhaps we can learn from one another. I live in Canada. How are things going for everyone now?

i have even done endoscopy two times during the last year, I'm still in pain all day and night, , ,I don't know what causing it, now I have been given drug for anti depression, ofcourse if I be in pain for this long I will get depressed,,,. I am going to try it anyways, maybe I am depressed and I don't know myself and that's all into it. I really can't find answer for this pain.
i wish everyone who got this pain get well soon. And please keep forwarding for any tips that might help

"A couple days ago I was searching online about gastritis medication and how long it takes to work. I was researching this for my mother who has been experiencing the same symptoms that you and many others on this thread have been experiencing. My mother too had tests done, blood tests urine tests ect...when we were at the hospital, doctors couldn't figure out what could be causing the pain, she was given every drug the hospital had and the only one that took the pain away was morphine, in exchange for the pain subsiding, she was throwing up excessively from the morphine. My mother suggested it might be gastritis, so they sent her home with a prescription of Prilosec, with hope this would relieve all this pain she's been in. 3 days later, with the pain not subsiding or getting better we went to another hospital and waited 7 hours to be seen by a doctor. She had more tests done including a ct scan and luckily we had an answer to all her suffering. It was a swollen pancreas due to a stone blocking her pancreas. Apparently gall stones can still form even without a gall bladder. (My mom had hers removed several years ago) eating food brings on more pain because the stone is lodged in the way of food passing through. I hope my post may help someone. I literally read every post on this thread and felt for everyone of you, as soon as we found an answer I immediately thought about coming on here and posting about it. Take care All!

"Hello Jenny
After 15 years of suffering with your symptoms and being palmed off with IBM over and over I feel your pain. I had the following tests
Endoscopy - normal and clear
Colonoscopy - normal and clear
Ultrasound - normal and clear
Blood tests - normal and clear for years but eventually developed B12 deficiency which I now receive 3 monthly injections for but didn't stop my issues.
Faecal samples both runny and normal both clear and normal results.
Allergy tests resulting in cutting out diary 6 months no change gluten 6 months no change wheat 6 months no change.
I paid to have colonic hydrotherapy didn't do anything.
I tried homeopathy nothing
I took loads of different prescribed and over the counter Meds over the years nothing touched it.
Last year I finally had enough. My friend had completely different symptoms to me but had recently been diagnosed with something called Endometriosis. (The lining of the womb grows outside of the womb on other organs)
I started researching it but the general symptoms didn't match mine. The only thing I noticed was that my stomach tended to be at its worst when I was fertile and around my periods.
Something in me was telling me that this is what I had. The only test that I hadn't had which is the was they find it for definite. Was something called a laporoscopy. This is where they make small incisions in your abdomen and go in with a camera. After months of fighting the doctors who would not except that I wanted a laporoscopy because my symptoms did not match I finally with the help of my GP got my way and went in for a laporoscopy.
They found what they described as MILD Endometriosis. And removed it with lasers. It will come back but my symptoms have not completely gone but have improved 90% and I am able to work out which foods to avoid at which times.
Please look into having a laporoscopy as Endometriosis effects thousands of women every day. It is such a strange and varied disease and at present takes a minimum of 8 years to diagnose. All of my examinations except the laporoscopy came back clear and normal. If what I have was classed as MILD Endometriosis I would hate to feel what severe feels like.
You may not have it but it's something for some reason that doctors don't seem to think of.

"Glad to know I'm not the only one with these same stomach issues. I'm 34 now and I've had all these symptoms since I was about 3 or 4 years old and no one has been able to figure out what the cause is or how to help me. Up until 2 years ago the flares of pain (like razor blades swimming in my stomach) and the constant nausea would happen maybe once a month but since then it's almost every day. The worst episode i had lasted a full month and was even causing me so much dizziness from the pain that i was always on the verge of passing out and still they can't find a cause. Going next week for another gastroscope to see if anything new has come up but I doubt it. I am going to look into the Aloe Vera, L-glutamine and Acidophilus Plus that some others on here mentioned and hopefully those can provide a bit of relief cause at this point I can barelly function.

So I went back to my doctor and he referred me to get an endoscopy which showed I have inflammation in the stomach, and the hpylori virus (I think that's how you spell it) I find out next Friday. They also took 4 biopsies which I'll find the results for that in 4 weeks time. I'm hoping and praying it comes back ok. We know when our bodies are not right, keep on pushing your doctor for the endoscopy, don't just keep taking the tablets, that could just be prolonging the problem. Good luck x

I currently have the exact same symptoms and basically went through the exact same experience (as far as going to the hospital and having all my tesr results be perfectly fine) as you. I know it has been years since this post but I really hope you or someone who's been in the same position can help because I desperately need help. I've been experiencing this pain for about a month and now I'm scared on the daily bases that I'll forever feep this way. So if you or anyone reading this have overcome their gastritis, please share with me how you did so.

"Jenny, I know it has been a while since you posted this information, and hopefully you have found a soultion. My mother has been going through this very thing for the past two years. What we FINALLY found is that the blood vessels that are supplying blood to her stomach were colluded. Out of three major vessels that supply the stomach, one is completely closed and the other two were very diseased. They placed a stent in the major vessel. Since my mother is elderly, they want to do the second one in a few months. THE RESULTS were miraculous! She can now eat and does not have ANY pain. I hope this is something that you haven't had checked and they can do the contrast CT and MRA (artery) to find the results for your own stomach. Best of luck!

"Dear Jenny, I Have IBS & Acid Reflux for which I take Mebeverine & Omeprazole. I Had My ENT Appt Recently & I was Prescribed Lansoprazole by the ENT Consultant, to Try to Eleviate My Reflux Symptoms, So I Took it & the First Day My Stomach was Stinging, But I Thought, I Have to Give it a Chance as it Seemed to Help My Throat a Bit So for 1 Wk I Took it, But, the Lansoprazole Made My Pain & Symptoms 10 Times Worse, I wish I never used the Wretched Stuff. And Now I'm Scared to Eat Nearly Everything I Eat Disagrees with Me, I get Belly Burn which I Never had B4, Except Whilst Taking Ibuprofen, Which I Haven't Touched Since, But the Allergic Reaction I Got from That, Didn't, Last as Long as This! My Insides are Hyper Sensitive Since I Took it, it Should be Banned! I Shall be Returning to My GP Pronto to Ask for Some Kind of Ante Dote Reversal to These Awful Life Changing Symptoms. I Tried Drinking Lots of Milk Which Seemed to Help, But Sadly the Relieving Effect of the Milk was Only Temporary. I Feel Like Suing. As I'm Already Pretty Poorly, I've Got So Much Health Problems, I Could Write a Book. But with My Fybromyalgia, Vertigo, Goitre, Arthritis, Sciatica. None of These Are More Debilitating Than This, My Meds Keep Things Ticking Over Nicely, But This! I Eat Things Fine for Me for Years & End Up in Agony, Doubled Up in Pain with Either Diarrhoea or Constipation!!!

"Hi...I am so thankful for all of the advice and chatting. My daughter who is just 16 is having this issue. She is adopted (has been here 2 years) and I do not want to run her through a bunch of tests. She has even been on the floor in tears in a ball position. She seems to wake up with pain gone and then it creeps on throughout the day. I am going to start logging her diet. I have been gluten free for 3 years and then I found out I couldn't tolerate dairy...so my diet changes has literally changed me. I hate that for a kid as I get it. I am very picky and eat like a kid....so just wanted to follow this chat line to get great tips. I am going to look into the alo vera as I know nothing about that. Thanks again for everyone's input and I am going to pray for those of you on here that are in pain.

Reading this discussion has actually made me feel a whole lot better knowing that I'm not alone but pain is awful and doesn't go away with flare ups as well. I've been taking tumeric and probiotics as well as kefir hoping it might help but so far nothing is working and they told me to not take Advil it Tylenol too but prescribed me oxy in which only covers it up.

"Hi Jenny. Hope this finds you feeling better? Just wondered if you ever got to the bottom of what was causing you to feel unwell? I have had very similar symptoms, and also mine has been on going for 3 years now!! I have had a number of cameras both endoscopy and colonoscopy I've had ultrasounds X-Ray's, blood tests urine and stool samples etc everything has come back pretty much fine slight inflammation here and there it nothing much. I have been under a specialist for the last year or two but again all results ok although did hear I have calcification on my prostate which I am seeing my GP about as this is not the area the specialist deals with.
My symptoms are symply feeling quite tender around middle of abdomen and also feeling quite sick. I can go few weeks with feeling quite good and very active but when it does hit me I really don't want to do much at all. I work shift work but keep my eating very simple now and quite plane. I like a beer but do not drink much and when I'm feeling good can have few beers without it changing this. I have cut out tea almost completely and only have one cup a day now. I have tried a lot of different midication, currently back on Lansoprazole in morning and amitriptylene before bed but like today feeling rather rubbish And so fed up with it ruining my life!!
I'm 33 year old male of small build and no other ilnesses.
Just wondered how you are and if you got to the bottoms of it.
All the best

I'm waiting on that one. For pain, and although they found no cancer, they put me on percocet, great to relieve pain. I lost 30 pounds in those months and little more. I hope one of these Doctors can find out what our problem is. I need a new stomach! Can they replace that??

"Hi Frank, very frustrating isn't it. Nice when results all come back clear and nothing sinister but still no closer to sorting out the problem.
One drink I have been taking for last couple of months is a tumeric and almond milk drink. Because I have cut out tea I like a hot drink of a night. It has been really good in helping me up until this week. Almost like body gets immune to anything that helps after few months. So frustrating.
Other problem you find with all these websites is people always put what's wrong but rarly come back with solutions of what is wrong.
Hopefully you get things sorted. If I do get any further with some answers I will post on here.
All the best
Terry.

"Hello, I thought as a fellow suffer in pain I would add my thoughts. I have a hernia hiatus which is caused by my fat belly. It causes acid to be pushed up into my esophagal at night, especially if I sleep in my right. This leaves the tube raw and swollen- but after some water /antacids I can get on with life. Now this brings me to my next set of symptoms. I recently had pneumonia and 3 lots of antibiotics - which has killed any good bacteria in my stomach as well. Found out this causes inflammation and pain in top rightish area of stomach- a lot of pain that no amount of antacids would relieve. So if I'm already raw from my hernia- this isn't going to help. So eating sauerkraut and bio yougurts and miso to build my good bacteria and bring g the inflammation down. Also took 1000mgof paracetamol to deal with pain ( hospital told me when I had pneumonia this was best way to take it- every 8hrs instead of 4- more effective). Also was taking ibuprofen for pneumonia - and it really hurts the lining of your stomach. Lastly I know that antacids and proton inhibitors actually back fire and make the body produce more acid after time, and also too low acid is bad as bacteria need it and we need it to properly digest. So when I lost weight a few months ago ( sadly put it back on) my acid reflux completely disappeared just like when I was younger and never has problems. These are my observations, take from them what you will.

"Hi Jenny
I have some similar symptoms
I am 5 half months post partum and about 8 weeks ago I started with a kidney infection i was on antibiotics for 8 days ..
But a few days later it seemed to move to my stomach I generally don't feel sick and don't have any burning or reflux but a uncomfortable stomach lots of trapped gas in upper stomach and ribs.. sometimes like im holding my stomach in and a little constipated.
I do suffer with anxiety which I think makes me worse.
I've had h pylori test bloods scan on kidneys nothing founds.. The pain moves around from one side to the other.. could this be gastritis???
I'm stuggling to look after my kiddies .. Some days I feel not to bad
Any suggestions anyone ???
Hope you get sorted Jenny x

"Hi Jenny,
I have literally the same story as you. I started having acid reflux symptoms in about 4th grade after I developed the chicken pox. My stomach has not been the same since. I have been diagnosed with celiacs and lactose intolerance as well as IBS and put on loads of different ant acids and still I havent improved. I also got an endoscopy where nothing was found. I was wondering if you had found any solutions that helped you?
Also, I have realized that at the end of july every year since about middle school I have gotten a lot of stomach and bowel issues during the end of july. I was wondering if you experienced anything similar to that. I havent found a solution yet but I am taking probiotics which help a little bit, I also have prescription strength anti nauseau pills and I am still searching for an answer. I was wondering if you have ever had the chicken pox, since I got them when I was in 4th grade and I feel like that is when all of my stomach problems started.
Good luck and I hope you find som relief!

"Wow, I have almost the same issues that you all have been discussing. To add on, I do have an umbillical hernia which gets really sore during flare-ups! My story is similar to Jenny's and some others. I have had these flare-ups for the last 9-10 months. I've had an ultrasound, endoscopy and colonoscopy and all three were clear. The episodes have been long (lasting a week) or short a day or so. I've varied the types of food (greasy, fatty, spicy, bland, etc) and there is rhyme or reason as to when ""it"" wants to flare-up. I did get a prescription for hyocyamine that dissolves under your tongue. I'm supposed to take it 3 times a day. I really don't see much improvement. I thought it was working and I had no flare-ups for 4-5 weeks, and then ""bam"", I had the worse one yet that lasted about a week. BTW, its swolen abdomen, rolling waves of cramps & pain and eating makes it worse. All I can say is, keep up the fight and hopefully and prayerfully there is a cure that will arise!

My only relieve is by eating (Red) Dragon Fruit, lots of it. And by the way i dont take any western medicine at any cost. I dont recommend eating fruits too acidic like pineapple to much or watermelon as some may have allergic. Dragon fruit (red) which i found to be the best for clearing my system and relieve my pains.

"Hi Olga, your condition appears to be very similiar to mine and truly i too at times do have the same feeling.. I do understand what you are going through. Sometimes I pray hard to make this problem disappear completely but sadly it does not work. I have been suffering from this 'mysterious' gastritis for almost 30 years now. I have seen 4 GE, done endo and colono few times but only end up consuming more and more medicine but never improve in long term, only temperorary relief. Imagine detected and treated with H Pylori 3 times through out. I have gone for yoga classess, breathing exercise, meditation etc. but yet to recover from this cursed problem.
Anyway for the last one year I have completely stopped all kind of medicine as I am quite positive that prolonged medicine consumption had infact worsened my condition. Though I am still having this problem but I do have some comfort knowing that I do not depends on tablets anymore, in reality problem persist with or without. I too has completely removed spicy food from my diet and stopped consuming alcohol. I have reduced overseas and oustation trip drastically, this somehow affected my business but I don't have a choice, guess people like us have to make alot of sacrifices to adjust our lifestyle. Sometimes I do envy those who are able to eat/drink anything they like or travel wherever they want to.
I do not know if I will ever get better but I still have positive mind and have faith in God. keep praying, you may never know... miracles do happen...

"Hi Jenny, I hope you get some good news soon!
I have a similar situation, but it has only gone on for about 5 weeks.
One night in bed I felt a slowly growing ache in my stomach to the point I thought I was going to vomit, but never did. Since then I have had a fairly constant ache everywhere in my abdomen including under my ribs, my hips, groin, lower back, and upper stomach. The pain is hard to explain because while there is a bit of nausea, it is mainly dull aches with some sharper pains in the areas I mentioned. The back aches are like when you get the flu, or when you wake up in the morning and you've really have to urinate so bad that've your lower back aches. I am guessing it's the kidneys? The pain moves around randomly and with different intensity. I have started the process of tests but it is scary. MY mind races with the fear of some cancer.

"Omg I'm so glad I found this thread!...I'm 27 and I to have been having stomach issues....I have never had issues ever until two months ago at the end of summer I started having this clearing throat sensation... I had partied alot over summer..At first I thought it was my lungs as I was having heavy breathing it felt like someone was squeezing My chest and my back felt like it was on fire... Turns out it was a silent reflux so the doctor said .. within a week I was having burning pain iny upper left part of my stomach that would go into my back while still having the squeezing in my chest. I ended up in the er 7 times over a month in so much pain I didn't know what to do with myself...had ultrasound done another chest x-ray blood work all Came back fine no hpylori... The think it's gastritis, or ulcers, or a hiatal hernia... I have been waiting for a endoscopy for a month now finally in 6 days I will have one...been extremely stressed out as I'm worried I have stomach cancer..... Unlikely yes is what I've been told...but I am an anxious worries person in general when it comes to my health....lost my mom to bileduct cancer 3 years ago so it's very touchy subject... I also have three little girls whom I love more then anything and am scared something will happen to me... I have lost 20 pounds in the last two months from all this not wanting to eat because of pain or when I finally have an appetite I get more pain everyday has been a flare up. I have been on 80mg of pantaprazole a day and 300mg of zantac a day plus Tums and or gaviscon.. I hate taking meds and have read up on how bad they can be for your gut.. honestly the internet can be a scary thing when googling your symptoms...I am hoping they will find the cause of all this and I can get back to feeling like me again..I have changed everything in my diet trying to feel better so far nothing is working . I quit smoking,drinking and im eating super healthy. I am staying away from gluten just to see of it helps. Made and apt with a naturopath bit that isn't till Feb I really hope this clears up by then.. I'm tired of people thinking I'm crazy because all my tests have come back normal yet this burning stomach pain will put me in tears . They say calm down an don't stress it's kinda hard not to when you don't know what's wrong. Really hoping for some answers reading this thread has helped me knowing im not alone out there.

"Hello Sarah after reading ur post I have to say I FEEL YOUR PAIN!!!! Literally. I have had stomach issues my whole life as far back as I can remember however over the years just got worse and worse eventually it got so bad I went to the Dr had colonoscopy and endoscopy and turns out I have gastritis with GERD (gastro esophageal reflux disorder) very painful I am on pantaprazole as well and I've been on it for about 3 months and finally I found RELIEF!!! Yes it took a while and did I think it was ever going to end NO! Also I found that taking tums and other antacids is not good especially if you have gastritis if I was you I would stop taking them so the pantaprazole has a chance to start working without other stuff messing with it so you can notice a difference. Good luck to you and I hope everything works out for you. If you have any questions feel free to ask I'm quite a bit older then you so I ha e a little more experience with LIFE.

"Hi, I'm sorry your are going trough so much. I'm a 27 yr old survivor. I've lost most of my family due to other people's actions. I've had pulmonary embolisms, died once, stokes, ulcerative colitis, hair loss, debilitating pain, unable to keep a job and so much more. Sheer pain does crazy things to the mind. It has cause me not only actual pain but phantom pain too because once the mind can't handle the pain in begs your body to do something. Sometimes a small dose of an antidepressant helps. I'm on a child dose. Took a while to find the proper drug and dose but it has helped with many anxiety, fear, depression, pain and other things I never thought I had or could be helped with. I know being told ""you're crazy"" and it's all in your head is like a knife to the heart when you feel physical pain. I've heard it so so so many times! Like you're just talking to walls when you're desperate.
""Everything will be okay in the end. If it's not okay, it's not the end.""
Negative thinking leads to negative emotions. Train your mind to be positive. Meditate, chakra, go see a counselor. There are options. And it's never too late.
I've been in and out of the ER for the past 2 weeks. I'm a changed bird. I've reached my limit but when I hear myself beating myself up for my life/illnesses/situation/the unfair shortened life; I stop. Breathe and remeber there's a reason I'm given this challenge. Pitting yourself isn't the answer. Take it from someone who has already tried suicide. It is NOT the answer. And I'm not saying you are thinking such thoughts but pain makes you into a person you don't even recognize. Especially when no one can give you at least an answer or the time to think of anything else but the obvious.
I'm not implying that this IS all in your head and the doctors are right but I personally needed harsh truthful eye opening words to wake me up from the dark cloak I had that I kept feeding. I'm being open about personal things only to help, this isn't easy for me but you matter. The world needs you. It takes the same amount of energy to think positive. It's not easy, it's a journey. I'm not there myself, or anywhere close to it. I am my own worst enemy. Imagine if we obsessed over the things we loved about ourselves instead.
You are not alone. I know the worst kind of sad is not being able to explain why. Or being in pain and feeling like you're being called a liar. But you're stronger than you let yourself be. Be gentle with yourself, you're doing the best you can. Sometimes what you are most afraid of doing is the very thing that will set you free.

Try what ever mental counceling or pills they offer. At this point, it's worth trying. Even if you got for it and it doesn't work you still WIN. You still had the guts to head straight into something that might frighten you. That bravery will take you places. And if it doesn't help that's when you put that middle finger up to the docs and yell HELP ME NOW! It's the game we unfortunately have to play to be heard. In the end it might just help the despair you feel and you can let your mind be a little free, and at ease while the focus is directed back to the actually problem you might have.
Much love and hopefull outcomes. I hope I could help even just a tiny bit. Xoxo

I've been dealing with GI problems for 13 years and I've learned you have to be your own advocate, put your foot down and demand an endoscopy. Some doctors just like to throw pills at people and tell them to come back in a month, meanwhile , the patient is still suffering damaging their insides. Stress, alcohol, smoking, diet, and anti inflammatory drugs can cause gastritis and make it worse. I hope this helps a bit. Oh and you can't really diagnose gastritis without the proper testing so not only does your doctor stink, she sounds very lazy.

Did any of the suggestion work for you or have you found another solution ?? All my fingers and toes crossed

"Hi Jenny,
I don't know if you're still checking these posts, but I thought I'd share my experiences. I'd had severe stomach pains, stomach swelling, and similiar symptoms to what you've experienced. I dealt with it for about 3 years and saw dozens of doctors and specialists before I got a diagnosis. Turns out I have insulin sensitivity. Although I'm not diabetic, my body doesn't agree with higher levels of insulin. I was put on a low sugar diet (max 50 gram of sugar a day) for 6 months, and after that I was able to gradually increase my sugar intake (to something a little more reasonable). After 2 weeks of the new diet, I started feeling marginally better. By 2 months I felt significantly better, and by 6 months I felt normal again. I've always eaten healthy in general, so this diagnosis seemed like bullsh*t when I got. But its the only thing that worked. Genetics just dealt me a bad hand, I guess. Anyway, I follow the diet plan that people with Type II Diabetes follow. Unlike diabetics, someone with Insulin Sensitivity can get away with cheating on the diet once or twice a week. I just don't do it regularly. I also found out that soy irritates my stomach. But that's a totally separate issue. But anyway, the symptoms were similiar though less severe.
I also have a friend that was diagnosed with celiacs disease in her late 20s. Severe stomach pains and stomach swelling were one of her symptoms. It took her almost a year to figure it out. Anyway, I hope you've found an answer and have started feeling better.

"Hi Jenny, hope you are feeling better but my wife has had a horrible process of doctors, tests and the like with nothing conclusive over 10 years now. Just a couple of ideas: get your doc to test for helicobactor pelori, (causes ulcers), try gluten free, ond lactose free for a while (at least a month), look up the fodmap diet (some foods are really bad for this) and the best first aid is to use slippery elm bark for a few weeks and see if that helps... it puts a lining on your stomach.
After years of difficulty my wife has gradually got better to the extent she is mostly free of trouble until she strays off the diet and she's back there again. A couple of years ago she had accute pancreatitis and the docs and I were very worried, they said alcohol is about 80% the cause (but she never has alcohol) and the other 20% is unknown cause. That doesn't mean she is not sick... just the docs don't know why, so try the dietry changes and see if that helps. She has gone off Lipitor (cholesterol lowering drug) and has had a remarkable turnaround.

"By the way, beware the antacids, doctors regularly goto this and unfortunately it can make things worse. Gastro can often be because your acids are LOW and antacid is a nono. Get the doc to check if you are vitamin B12 deficient.

"Hi gipsy,
My mom seems to have to exact symptoms as your wife. Although she hasn't been 'cured', as well as following a diet like your wife, since she started drinking Kefir every morning she found that this helped settle her stomach a lot more. I am also having stomach problems and I find kefir to be really soothing, and puts my day off to a good start. I really recommend it! Hope your wife's feeling a lot better.

"Thanks Shannon, I think kefir is coconut yoghurt, is that correct? My wife has tried that an she did enjoy it. The most beneficial thing for her has been the slippery elm bark whenever she strays off her diet. Hope you and your mom feel better. Cheers Gipsy

"Jenny did you ever get this resolved or find the name of your illness? This is Donna in Edmonton Alberta Canada. Ive been sick since August of last year and in November it took a turn for the worse. I had to cut out all sugar fats and ate next to nothing just bottles of water all day long. I dont see a gastrointestinal internal specialist till Feb 8th. I lost 20 lbs in 30 days. They too gave me lansoprazole but it does not stop the pain. I think its pancreatitis as my pancreas enzyme levels were too high for awhile. No dr. I see seems to care or want to help.

"Donna has anyone tested your lipase with a blood test? High lipase usually means pancreas problem. 80 percent is alcohol caused while 20 percent is bacteria toxins like lipitor for lowering cholesterol. Also in that 20 percent the doctor can't define the cause. Lookup fodmap diet, gluten-free and lactose free. Also if you have any auto immune issues that could be a factor. Cheers Gipsy

"Hi Jenny,
I am feeling the same right now. I was told by my doctor that I have gastritis and gave my prescription Lansoprazole Actavis 30 mg once daily for 4 weeks. I am taking the prescription religiously 30/60 before meal. But pain in my stomach never go away and it is more painful at night tine. I am so sore.
What to do when it flares up especially at the middle of the night? Please advise.

"Hi Jenny , I was wondering if there has been anymore developments with your stomach. I have been having severe pains in mine and find it difficult to breathe. I've put it down to anxiety as well . I feel everything is bruised inside. My back and ribs are sore too. Doctors say it's IBS but I feel it's something else. I've taken xanax to see if it will calm my stomach down but no joy I'm also on pantoprazole 40mg , but I don't feel any better. It is draining and I feel tired all of the time. Please let me know if anything worked or helped you.

"Dear fellow sufferer,
I feel your sorrow and I would just love to share because I was in the same shoes and thought my life was ending so i would love to help.
What you are experiencing and children are experiencing are parasite infestation, small harmful organisms living in your stomach. This could be one type, or several types of parasites wreaking stomach issues.
Based on the symptoms you desribed, the attack sounds like a parasite called h.pylori. which is sometimes difficult to detect, this bacteria lives in your stomach lining and destroys it sapping you from iron and continuing to make all sorts of symptoms. If not treated eventually will lead to stomach cancer at old age. In younger ages, you may develop several ulcers and heal constantly from time to time, so don't panick just yet, because its also curable. Your body will build antigen to fight this parasite, but they will have a fight or flight mode that will hide their precence by hiding under sugar.
My recommendation go to a specialist for parasites who can do a full stool analysis. Parasitology is not that expensive. I would only do this route as it will be more accurate and lease inasive. You may also do a breath test or blood test if you want which are the least expensive.
For now eat a strict vegetarian diet, green tea, manuka honey. But you may eat a steak once in a while to up your protein, as h.pylori loves stealing your protein.
Avoid sugar, which they will use to grow and camouflage from tests. Spicy, greasy, acidic and fried foods will rile them up causing hyper activity. Antacids may also help. You may have to go this diet for a year, until your whole family is treated.
General doctors may not know what's wrong with you, the human body is very complex and doctors may oversee a lot of things, take the doctors advice but trust your own body too. This is your life and in order to be happy you have to get as many second opinions as you can afford. These bugs also sap your seratonin which makes you depressed. So its all worth it to find out whats wrong.
Good luck and i hope this cures you.

"I literally was just diagnosed with a ""bacterial overgrowth"" in my small intestine. This was done by having a breath test, which was super easy to do. I've been sick since October 2016. It's been a nightmare of gut pain every day, especially since they couldn't find any h-pylori in my stomach after my endoscopy in December. But due to my symptoms they scheduled the test and it looks like they've been hiding in my intestines. I'm wondering if that's normal? Anyways they're putting me on biaxin for two weeks. I can't wait to heal up, and I'm especially happy to know I'm not crazy! Keep following up with your doctors folks-no matter how long you've been sick or how bleak your pain makes your situation seem. May we all start to feel better soon!

"Hi Everyone,
I am so glad I am not alone. About 3 month ago this pain started. So debilitating. Some days are more severe than others. Pain is like a band around my upper stomach and back. If I had to pinpoint the pain, it is in the upper center. Been to GP and ER. Had endoscope, colonosopy, CT with dye, and xray. Endoscope came back with diverticulosis, and scar from ulcer, as well as bile reflux (gallbladder removed in 2013). Colonoscopy came back with some thinning of intestine but no polyps. CT showed nothing other than constipation and Xray just showed air (gas). I was given Diludad (sp?) but did nothing for the pain. 2nd ER gave me Fentinal (sp?) did nothing except hallucinate-ick! Just had parathyroidectomy a week ago. Was hoping to find relief as abdominal pain is one of the many symptoms. But no-still am getting the pain. Eating, not eating doesn't make a difference. Can't find triggers for the pain. Sometimes Norco with help but other times it will not make a dent in the pain. Tried beet juice, and aloe juice, but do not notice a difference. Same with peppermint tea and ginger tea. I am quitting my job as I do not know when I will feel ok to work. I feel so discouraged and overwhlemed. Why can't anyone help us or care to? I have to keep trying. I have found massaging my colon helpful for bloat. I try to do it for 20 minutes. If anything helps, even for a bit, I will post it. Good luck.

"Hi Jenny,
Have you been tested for
H-Pylori? (a common bug which sometimes causes stomach problems).
The test for this is a very simple stool test.
The treatment is 2 types of antibiotics for 1 week and proton pump inhibitors for 3 weeks.
My symptoms are very similar to yours and I have had 3 bouts of this over the years.
Recently my symptoms have returned but testing this time proved negative. Due to a family history of stomach cancer and the connection to it with H-Pylori my GP referred me for an endoscopy.
This found erosive gastritis and a small polyp. I was prescribed a 3 month course of a PPI 40mg and had a repeat endoscopy 2 weeks ago.
The repeat endoscopy found the gastritis almost cleared and the polyp almost gone.
I was also given an upper GI and pelvic scan which was clear.
My problem is that my upper stomach was still very sore to touch with repeated burping and chest pain. I asked if the PPI could cause this and the gastrologist said it's possible and suggested changing to another type or reducing them.
I have reduced to 20mg and for the last week I have taken a 20 billion probiotic along with a small probiotic drink every morning. Since taking the probiotics I have seen a marked improvement in the symptoms ( not gone but 75% better). I shall continue this with fingers crossed
Testing for H-Pylori is a good place to start and none invasive as are probiotics. I believe there is also a natural way to eradicate this bug if you don't want to take the antibiotics.
Good luck Jenny

"Had insomina for three night , I suffer with aniexty and panic attacks, so I got aniexty because of lack of sleep , with anxiety I get aCid reflux so now that I felt like sleeping I could not because of the acid reflux and aniexty , it was not going and got worst even after natural methods , like ginger tea and baking soda , so I decided to take make aloes Juice, well I believe I did not follow with the methos to mix it and made it very strong and felt weak , oh before taking aloes my lower stomach felt heated as well, any ways I took pills for the acid refluxs that same day an hour apart and it helped a lot , must say I took nexium some days before and it never helped. So because I normally get aCid reflux from aniexty , and it normally goes away and I can eat anything when it goes , I ate anything for two day and it came back worst than before, took the tablets I took that helped and it was not much help , began drinking coconut water , and ginger tea through out the day and it helped a bit , ended up drinking an alcoholic beverage and just a sip burned right through me , it got worst , my aniexty give me headaches and I got light headed, took the same tablet and nothing , next '2 day felt light headed and my stomach felt raw , could not walk to far and it burned , decided to follow instructions on how to use the aloes, the last time I felt weak and the aloes made me itchy , this time I made it and put cucumber, and coconut water and not an aloes and that same day the burning in my lower abdomen stopped , second day I'm not holding my stomach while I walk , I plan to take it for atleast a month to see what happens . StI'll gonna check a doctor though. Also felt dull pains on and off in my lower stomach and once in a while a little movement while my stomach burned

Yes, it's been pretty tough and still going though it as we speak. Have a docs appointment this morning as he gave me meds for the ulcers, infection etc..: hasn't worked and I did forget to mention he did referred me for a ultrasound for my liver and gallbladder: results negative, as well as blood work negative. Changed my diet, did lose weight of course! But when I lay down is when it bothers me the most. I'm at work and I get flare ups and yes it's very frustrating! I will have my doctor to do a full blood count to check other organs and a endoscope. I did try baking soda with lemons and for some reason it made me burp and pass gas a lot more.

"Hi everyone. Just another person living with this horrible illness. Mine started out as a flu/sore throat (an infection which I still interestingly have today) in which I was prescribed antibiotics. Halfway through the course I began experiencing bloating and painful stomach gurgling which came on all of a sudden. This continued on for a few weeks so I ceased the antibiotics because I was convinced it was giving me the terrible pain (knowing full well the implications of not finishing the pack). I then started experience severe upper abdominal pain that was just below my sternum and would creep under my left rib cage (when it got really bad). When it was really bad my stomach would spasm just with my rib pressing on it when expanding to breathe. It also would make awful gurgling/spasming noises which made me very anxious at work knowing people could hear it! (And my pants unzipped at work because of the bloating wasn't a good look) i self diagnosed myself with a lot of gas and starting taking de-gas along with other over the counter meds like buscopan to no avail. I finally went back to the gp to have my stomach looked at and he made me do a stool test (which was pos for Aeromonas and blastocystis hominis). He then started me on more antibiotics, ciprofloxacin and promised me my symptoms would subside! Phew I thought!! Well..... unfortunately my symptoms didn't subside and I was referred to have an upper ultrasound done to test liver function, gall bladder and pancreas - results ALL CLEAR as were my blood tests. I was then referred to a gastro specialist that told me that my symptoms were quite ""vague"" - my bowel movements were normal at this stage and he would need to investigate further with an endoscopy/colonoscopy. The procedure came back fine- only a single erosion ulcer on my terminal ileum but no evidence of crohns, U/C etc. h pylori biopsy also negative. Following this test I began to have some strange bowel movements- a blood globule in my stool and often white mucous (booked into my specialist straight away but couldn't get in for a few weeks) I was convinced that my problems were also diet related, not that I was unhealthy beforehand but thought with all my doctor google research, cutting gluten and dairy out could help. I followed the low FODMAPS diet and further the auto immune paleo diet for about 2 months (with a nutritionists support) along with some omega ease and high strength probiotics which she prescribed but didn't see any improvement unfortunately. I continued living in pain and desperation for another month until I decided to make another appointment despite the surgeon saying I was ""fine"". He is now suggesting a pill cam test to rule out small bowel Crohn's disease (family history) and in the meantime start on colofax to soothe the symptoms. Interestingly enough he also suggested I start taking a small dose of an anti depressant that has worked ""miracles"" for those suffering with chronic pain and IBS. He seems to think that this whole thing has been brought on my anxiety or stress (which I must admit I am quite a worryer and have started a new job in the last 6 months so it is possible) however I can't help but think something is really wrong with my health. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced symptoms like these or has a way to manage the pain? It almost seems like the unknown is just as bad as the illness itself.

"Oh my goodness! Another person who knows what I experience!! I’ve had this exact problem for 2 years now, it’s been getting worse as time goes by, seeing a stomach specialist on Tuesday 3rd. My main concern is that I can’t carry on like this because I am in my final year of high school (I am 16 years old, and a boy) and the problem is taking such a strain on my education. I’ve had to go from having dairy to no dairy, and now turned vegan, this is due to ALL FOODS giving me a stomach ache, and tablets that don’t do anything for me! How’s your problem now, I got diagnosed with gastritis age 10, but became a massive problem after I got back from France in 2015! Hope you are doing better, and wonder if you have any tips because I can’t carry on like this

"Hi jenny. I have had a similar condition for 6 years with no diagnosis as yet. I had intermittent pain for weeks on end having to take strong painkillers which eventually made me ill. I feel sick everyday and have to take nausea tablets. This week I can only lay on the couch or to go to bed with a hot water bottle. I bought a electric one.I have been though manty tests over the last 6 years and still don't know what it is. I have had three stomach ulcers in the past and gastritis and duodenitis . I feel severe pain all the time too and can't help thinking the worse. I was recently diagnosed with diverticulitis, but its not that' pain in the wrong place. Other people don't realise how bad the pain is. I have had my appointment with the Gastroenterologist brought forward to October the 17th and it can't come soon enough.. I will probably have to have another camera down my stomach. Even though I don't like hospitals, I wish I could go in now and have the tests.

I know you posted this years ago, but if you are still having trouble, have you tried over the counter Betaine HCl pills? With Gastritis it’s actually possible that you don’t have enough acid in your stomach.
I have a type of autoimmune disease where my body killed all my hydrochloric acid productions beta cells so I have severe Gastritis symptoms. Besides taking the pills, I have had to go off all foods except protein and veggies- all in small amounts. Funny thing is though, I keep gaining weight! It’s really discouraging. Anyways, if you see this I hope you are better!

"I am yet another with the same situation hitting me hard. It's been over 2 months now without being able to eat anything without pain or discomfort. I've been to urgent care several times, my GP as well, had blood, fecal, urin, xrays all done and all came back negative. I've been put on a total of 8 new medications to see what works with no noteworthy success. Wearing a bra, tight shirts, or buttoning up jeans are all out of the question, and the nausea/pain doesn't fade with any particular way or sitting or Laying or standing or pills or what I eat/what I dont. It just fades to a flu like sickness, before increasing every few hours to unbearable.
Im scheduled for an ultrasound tomorrow and a GI specialist in a week or so, but I don't have much hope right now.
It's comforting to know others have felt whay you have, but it's also horrible to know it hasn't really improved for anyone. I've lived with chronic pain from endometriosis most of my life now, and with this added on it truly is zapping the will to keep going. I feel so young to say that, and my partner and I wanted to have children in the next two years, but I can't imagine living life constantly like this. I can't imagine starting a family and just having this pain constantly keep me from being apart of my kids life. I can't even focus on tv or conversation half the time, the pain just makes everything else become white noise.
I've had a bad mental state for a few weeks now, increasing with every negative test. I've already cut out most food, but I was eating breads as something soft in my stomach. Usually I don't want to eat, id rather just starve if it hurts either way I guess. I'm going to try the home remedies listed above, despite the seeming lack of success overall. I truly am greatful to hear others went through this, but I wish health for every one of you, and am so sorry you're going through this as well.
It's getting so expensive, with no results.

"Hey Bun, you should try to stay off the bread. Try to avoid anything with gluten or added sugar in the ingredients list. Look into intermittent fasting and also into grass fed bone broth for nutrition and satiating your hunger if you feel nauseous often. Don't give up hope. There IS an answer to all of this and we will figure it out. I'm a research bloodhound and WILL find out what's going on.

"So my husband was having symptoms for about a month, upper left abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, headaches. The stomach pains and nausea was so bad he couldn’t really eat. Lost 30 lbs in the month, went to gastroenterologist had colonoscopy, endoscopy, barium swallow with iodine injection and a motility test and all the blood work!! Everything came back normal!!! I tell my chiropractor the symptoms and she says immediately it’s a spastic gallbladder and gives me Cholacol & Zypan which are bile salts and enzyme supplements that anyone can get online and he’s been taking 2 of each with each meal for a week now and the symptoms are gone!!! They apparently break down the sludge in the gallbladder that is causing the spasms!!! Just FYI so other people might try it also because the spasms won’t show on tests!

"Hi Jenny. I will the enzyme supplements a go. I have been prescribed buscopan to relax my gallbladder, but it does nothing for the pain and other symptoms. Thank you.

"I wondered if anyone could help me, since about January 2013 I have on and off had a dull ache in my stomach, sometimes flaring up to make me feel sick. I actually put this down to anxiety however in the past few weeks my theory has changed.
About three weeks ago my stomach flared up however to the worst pain I have experienced as yet, made me feel like I was going to be sick constantly and made me not know what to do with myself. I feel like there is a lump in my thought and my stomach feels tender and swollen when flares up feels like my stomach is on fire/knotted up!
The pain was so sever I went to the doctors (2 and a half weeks ago), my doctor felt my stomach and said it felt swollen, I told her the symtoms and she says she thinks I have gastritis and prescribed me with Lansoprazole 30mg tablets to take daily for 1 month, this however to date hasn't helped my stomach at all, the flare up comes and goes however the pain in my stomach is constant and the Lansorprazole is causing terrible upset stomach to the point I am worried to not be near a toilet.
I went back to the doctors on Tuesday 22/10 explained all of the above to her and she said I am to keep taking the tablets and she is happy to see me again in November (once the months course has been taking) however im in dispear with this pain HAD ENOUGH OF FEELING ILL and can't help but think the worse
Has anyone experienced symptoms same as above as I feel extremely on my own shouting and no one understanding what im going though

"Hi Jenny,
Just wondering if your still experiencing gastritis pain? I am currently having extreme burning pain. Meds aren’t helping. In fact my symptoms are getting worse. Thanks

"I can't believe there are so many people with similar symptoms that are being undiagnosed. I've had the symptoms for about 3 weeks and have been scouring the internet looking for answers. My dull pain mostly on my right side under my liver, pulses on and off all day for no reason. I'm being set up for a colonoscopy. Not sure what that will show. The pain is more annoying than anything and is sometimes accompanied by a wave of heat throughout my stomach area. Obviously for most of us, the pain just doesn't feel right...like organ failure or something not right.
I don't drink or smoke. I need to exercise more, but I eat pretty healthy. Lots of fruits and veggies, healthy meat, barely any sugar, no caffeine and organic whenever possible. I drink almost strictly filtered water.
I've done a lot of research on fasting and intermittent fasting having great success in resetting your gut and microbiome. I just ate my last meal (6oz. Flank steak, steamed broccoli and some fresh fruit) at 2pm today. I'm going to fast for 24 hours and then eat 6oz of protein and about 18oz of steamed vegetables and then fast again for 24 hours. Then do intermittent fasting where I only eat betterment noon and 6pm and fast the other 18 hours. Eating only small protein portions and unlimited steamed vegetables during that 6 hours.
From what I've been reading and researching, it should hopefully solve the problem unless I actually have some type of serious issue. I'm 6'6"" 230lbs so fasting isn't easy...lol....but it's all a mindset. All you feel is hunger and your brain trying to make you give up and eat. I can deal with that.
I'll report back as I make it through my fasting test. In the mean time, good luck to everyone trying something to help themselves. .

"I would just like to say to anybody who found themselves here reading all these posts that sound very familiar to your own symptoms. To please do yourself a HUGE favor and research SIBO and a naturopathic doctor who specializes in IBS/SIBO named Dr. Jason Klop. His page and seminars are free, you just need to sign up for them from his Facebook page. What we are all dealing with, are the results from poor dietary choices we made in our lives, that have caused certain things to happen in our bodies, incorrectly. This is completely 100% reversible with modifications to your diet, which will create the changes needed in your digestive system, which will then alleviate everything from cramps, pain, diarrhea, constipation, sinus issues, migraines, headaches etc...
Don't cheat yourself out of this opportunity to finally right your ship. This IS the answer. No medicine is going to help you. You don't need your doctor to do this. You likely have small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).

"I don't know if anyone is still reading these responses, but I also have this Mysterious stomach pain. I did actually get diagnosed with H-Pylori about 4 years ago and took the massive amounts of antibiotics to cure it. But i am still having this chronic stomach pain. I've had an endoscopy, ultrasound, gallbladder check. Everything clear. I have tried reading many articles to try and pinpoint the issue. Eating foods that are not too hot or too spicy, cut out coffee. Stay relaxed and not stress out. Every time i think i have it figured out it will mysteriously pop up out of the blue. BUT I have reduced the pain from once a month to just once every couple of months.
My doctor prescribed me HYOSCYAMINE for STOMACH SPASMS. THIS HAS BEEN A LIFE SAVER. They are small pills that dissolve under the tongue and the pain will be completely gone with an hour. HOWEVER timing is important because there have been some times i have taken it and it doesn't fully work but it does lessen the pain.
WHEN THE PAIN STARTS, I don't eat anything until the pain goes away I ONLY have sips of water or lemon water. Unfortunately sometimes I will go hours without eating but its worth it because having even a crumb will make my stomach hurt worse. So after hours of only drinking water the pain will start to subdue and then once I feel less or no pain I only have liquid food like Milk, yogurt or cream of chicken soup but don't chug it because you are starving, just take a small spoonful and wait a few minutes to see if it brings the pain back, if not you are safe to eat liquids. I don't eat solid foods until the next day. Also if I am home while waiting for pain to go away it makes my back feel like there is a dagger stabbing me right in the middle. I lay down on my left side with a heating pad on my back and try to take a nap, this is helpful in reducing pain as well.
I hope this helps someone. Its not a cure, but how I have managed to reduce and deal with this pain for the last 4 years. I hope to go to the doctor this coming year and see a specialist and allergy doctor and hopefully one day get a real diagnosis of what is happening to our stomachs!!!

"I was so relieved to findthis post & all the other discussions on this topic !! I have the same upper abd. Pain, the nausea, the feeling in my tummy like theres a heavy ball in there, then it just aches and all of this has been going on for over a year. Same as so many others, all tests done to date are negative, yet the symptoms remain. Next test is upper GI, but they wanted $1000 before they would schedule it, even with my ins., so haven't been able to have that one. In the mean time, im o n Carafate, protonex, pepcid, mylanta and a probiotic. A friend recently sent me a link about a Kombucha drink. Its a fermented cold drink found in a grocery store. I added that to my arsenal and have had a calming down down of the terrible pain and nausea! I've been a nurse for 36 years but this has me stumped, as well as my doctors. Thank you so much for your posts, i dont feel so all alone in my battle. I will research the other recommendations also. My sister gave me a soup recipethat helps with gallbladder issues, but i did get a good result using it: 2 zucchini 's, 20 green beans, one bunch parsley, & 4-5 stalks of celery. Steam these together for about 10 mins., then puree. I would eat this for lunch and dinner for about 2 days, and the relief was amazing. I slowly add tolerable foods back in as tolerated. For me this works. Im 5 days into my latest flare up, so will make the soup in addition to everything else (meds) and hope for relief. I wish us all relief in whatever works for us!

"I've felt nauseated everyday for months, but when I ate it did seem to help. This was about 10 years ago. At that time I was told to get my Vitamin D checked. It was very low, and I begin to get Vitamin D shots, and I was so surprised did it help, a lot. And to my surprised my fingernails even begin to grow. I always assumed I was one of those people whose nails just didn't grow. I also had acid re-flux and got on medicine. My stomach still gets upsets from time to time but nothing like it was before. I don't know if this helps, but I wish you all the best.

"Has anybody found a cure yet? I have had an awful pain for about a week now. It started near the middle of my esophagus and stomach which landed me in the ER. Now it comes and goes and it’s mainly in the middle of my belly, like where my intestines are. I no longer have diarrhea. Someone’s response on this thread was very similar to mine. When I eat, it gets better. When I don’t it gets worse. I’ve been surviving off of chicken noodle soup crackers and a smoothie made of peaches, papaya and honey. Nothing works. The PA at the hospital prescribed me a stronger dosage of OTC Pepcid which has not helped. I also had an ultradsound done because they thought it was an ulcer. Negative. I’m really worried and petrified that this pain will never be resolved.

"Hi Jenny, I have been reading through this thread and feel for everyone here. My Dad had pain every time he ate solid food from last Feb 2017. He would not eat or only have liquid smoothies for a couple of days then come good. He would then try eating something solid and end up with loads of pain again. He went to a doctor that only gave him a laxative and told him he was having trouble from his divaticulitus. He had had a colonoscopy 6 months earlier as he did yearly. He had had bowel cancer twice twenty years earlier. He eventually had two stints on hospital where they did a CT scan the first time and endoscopy the second time. They told him they were checking his eusophicus the last time which infuriated him as it was his bowel that was having the trouble. They sent him home after a week in hospital and gave him a follow up appointment in two months time. My Dad died of a heart failure at home 5 days after discharge in September last year. I feel from stress of the condition and not being able to eat much for 8 months.
Now I’m Feb 2018, this year, I started having the same problem. I already eat Paleo and actually more Keto so don’t have any grains or sugars, been doin that for 3 years now. I’m having thre days of pain then only having water and protein shake for a day or two then have two days of relief, then the pain starts again. I’m wondering if anyone here has considered Fecal Transplant Therapy? I know it sounds out there but I’m thinking of seeing if I can get into a trial. I have taken notes of everything everyone here has tried and will start on those and book a doctors appointment. With all the pain and what has happened to my Dad this whole thing just has me so scared and sad.

"OK here's my story. Exactly three years ago I started having burning sensations in my stomach for weeks then it would pass. This went on for about a year. I went for tests ultrasound, bloods and stools. I haven't had a solid poo for years on end. It got me down, almost losing my marriage as I was very down and most of all angry and irritable. I still went to work but it was so hard. I just wanted to be at home l you down. Luckily my child was only a few years old so didn't understand. Doctors put it down to ibs. This was even more frustrating. I then started taking strong probiotics (Holland and barret) and aloe Vera tablets overnight. This was a revelation. I only had a hand full of flare ups in two years which would last just a few days. There has never been any pattern from the start I terms of food. I have however over the last four weeks been in turmoil. Its come back and it feels worse than ever. Burning, trapped wind, depression. Feels like I'm a different man from the happy guy the last two years. I fully understand all how you are feeling. I get angry with my wife my child. Very short fused. I feel like I need to be away from them. I'm thinking of going back to the drs but I almost know he will say ibs. At my wits end again. Dread waking up thinking how the day will pan out.

"Well after I posted on here I followed one of the leads and watched some Jason Klop YouTube clips which lead me to investigate SIBO small intestine bacterial overgrowth. From there I looked into Murdoch University’s FODMAP diet, bought the app and within days everything cleared up. As my Dad died with the same symptoms as I think the stress and pain contributed to his heart failure I so wish I had found all this earlier. I hope this info can at least help some of you
