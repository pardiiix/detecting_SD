# detecting_SD


First, copy and paste glove 100d to directory. Then, run CNN_model.py. This trains the model and saves it to saved_cnn_model.h5.
After the model has been trained, run load_keras_model.py. This will give you the predictions. (open any csv file in the code (line 72)that you need to examine).

Or, you can just use the saved_cnn_model.h5, which I have trained, and run load_keras_model.py.

To do: 
create an empty text file for the predicted positive class, and a separate one for predicted negative class & get the statictics for each file.
