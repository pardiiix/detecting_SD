"I have a continual, deep pain/ache in practically the whole of my leg. I use ice on it (frozen peas!) a great deal of the time and I take my pain killers. At night I cannot sleep because there is nowhere New I can put my leg which does not become become equally painful within a few seconds. Anybody else have this problem?

"Knee replacement 10 days ago!! It is such early days yet. I wonder if anyone/hospital gave you any information or idea of what to expect after the op?
I had mine 11 weeks ago now. I was seen at pre-op clinic, all info was given and an in depth booklet of information for before and after surgery answering 99% of the things that you might worry or ask about.
I would certainly mention the deep pain/ache in your leg to GP/Hosp just to rule out any problem. I can only go on my experience as everyones circumstances/recovery may be different.
In early weeks like you I felt quite a lot of pain and it would go down my shin bone but mostly pain was around knee itself. I found it hard to sleep for long I was in/out bed at least three times a night not knowing where to put the leg for total comfort. I found taking my painkillers at regular times was a great help and doing last of physio exercises about an hour before bed and then sitting with the Ice Packs given from the hospital on the knee to cool it down after physio - to help sleep I would lie on my ""good side"" put a pillow between my knees so the bad knee was comfortable or lie on back, put a pillow under bad knee its just comfort for a while but as the weeks go on it gets better. I only started to sleep without pillow at 8 weeks and was sleeping for about 4 hours now I am sleeping for approx. 6+ still a little restless. Each morning I feel like the knee has seized up and takes a while to get going but I do exercises bending knee etc and its fine after about half hour. If I sit for too long it seizes up and I have to stand for a second or so before moving off. I am still going to Physio as I don't seem to have enough bend on the knee and its still really painful to do also I cant go down stairs easily yet too painful. It is a long process so don't despair you will get there.
Are you doing leg exercises? use Ice pack or peas (can burn skin) wrap in a tea towel. Use after exercises it will take the swelling down and feels good.
