"I would like to estabish contact with anyone who has undergone ankle replacement surgery and reflect a ittle on the aftereffects and the longer term prognoses for recovery and mobility."
"Having undergone such an operation about 9 months ago I am currently coming to terms with a less than welcome (and certainly unexpected) imapct upon my life and mobility."
"Issues such as lack of mobility, excessive swelling and cronic pain from the ankle itself but also from the toes and lack of sensation and feeling in parts of the foot are those I am facing and would like to know how other poeple have fared, both in the short and longer term."

"My wife had her ankle replacement three weeks ago."
"She's been essentially bed-ridden for the last three weeks and faces another week before physio starts."
"The wound is healing well, but she's battling with pain and discomfort as she wrestles with trying to get mobility back into her ankle in a plastic boot/removable cast."
"I'm not sure we'd have anything to help you in your situation (especially as your op was now about 18 months ago, but it might be good to get in contact."
"As a 7 month post op TAR I was wondering how your wife is progressing. I guess she is a couple of months ahead of me. I have good mobility most days but I'm not without pain. I am able to walk my dogs again for about 2 hours, three times a week and this is over fairly rough terrain. I get no significant swelling but the pain is sometimes debilitating. Am I expecting too much too soon?"
"Most doctors say it takes a year for any surgery to be really classified as fully healed... So give it some more time... If time doesn't help talk to the doctor, they are the experts in what's going on"

At the same time she felt I needed an insole to support the arches. I bought the boots and wear them at work Monday to"
"Friday It works! Within 2 weeks the swelling ad subsided. Most of the pain had gone and I feel much more mobile and at ease. I am still working with the hospital orthotics dept on an insole but I don't feel this"
"is germane to the ankle problem Believe me it changed the whole situation almost overnight. After 2years of regret I now feel the operation was worthwhile. Hope this may help looking forward or indeed coping with the current early days despair."
"I have a friend who had surgery on his ankle about 18 months ago, and he says if he'd known the extent of the pain and the disappointing outcome he'd never have considered it. He has to wear flat heavy-looking footwear, and as a female used to dainty heels (thing of the past) its bad enough wearing 'sensible' shoes without going down the orthotics route."
"His surgeon says the operation was a success - meaning he did what he intended to do with rods and pins, and the healing is complete - so there's nothing more to be done. This is unsatisfactory for the patient who is still in pain and has even more reduced mobility than before."
"I shall struggle on with whats left of my original bones."
"I do hope you can get sufficient physio to help you regain some mobility, I find swimming helps a little, but not much."
"be painfull & long recovery. My ankle is not too bad now. Doc is pleased. I am not happy with the effects on my foot. Doc does not have much concern about that."
"My foot is very sore and stiff. My balance is off. I can do about 60 % of my normal physical work. A leisuraly walk is out of the question. All my energy and endurance must be saved for necessary activity. I am concerned and disapointed, I thought I would be further along. Doc says foot can be fixed with simple sugery. Not intereste, thanks anyway. I do not have the level of pain that I had pre surgery. My mobility is very comprised, toes and forefoot stiff and painfull."
"I had a WRIGHT TAR in the USA"
"I had an Wright Infinity ankle replacement in California. I'm 19 months post op and very happy. I can say I have my life back! It takes a full two years to completely recover."
"I understand that this will be a long and painful journey, but is there any advice that you can share with me that helped you?"
"Hi Shanda. I'm jumping in univited. I crushed my ankle in 1991 and lived with moderate pain for 26 years while researching ankle replacements and waiting for the right one to come along. Earlier this year I decided to have my ankle replaced with the Infinity Inbone/Prophecy system. My surgery was June 9, 2017. I was given nerve blocks for pain which wore off after 24 hours. My surgeon prescribed 60 Oxycodne pills but informed me that only 2 of his many patients ever needed to use all of the pills. I began taking the pain medication on the morning following my surgery to ""stay on top of the pain"". I took 4 pills that day and night. The next morning I woke to discover that my pain wasn't any worse than prior to the surgey. I took 3 pills that day and each of the next 2 days. After that I took 1 pill prior to bedtime to help me sleep for about another 10 days. My ankle was basically pain free. I'm now about 10 weeks post surgery and the only pain I've had has been related to stretching and strengthening my muscles and tendons. I took 1 more pain pill after a day in which I broke up some scar tissue on the right side of my ankle. I'm in an aircast now and will be for another 2 weeks at which time I visit my surgeon with the expectation that I will be placed into my regular shoes. I'm currently able to walk with or without shoes with no pain, just stiffness which should go away over time, but I do stay in the aircast as most of the time per my surgeon's advice. I know each operation is unique as are each patient and each doctor. I just figured I'd let you know that for me the pain was a huge non-issue, especially after reading all of the horror stories. I hope you see the same results with the Infinity that I have.."
"I had a TAR five years ago and am waiting to have it revised due to osteolysis. It seems that there was some evidence of it at the time of surgery but it was not dealt with and it spread."
"This is just to warn everyone to be aware that osteolysis can effect all joint replacements but it seems that it is potentially a bigger hidden danger for ankles. Please confirm with your surgeon at each check up that there is no evidence of it."
"The surgery transformed my life but the future looks bleak but hopefully you will be fine."
"Cheers Richard"
"Thanks for the notice. My research prior to my surgery did not pick up any instance of this condition."
"I did some searching online last night and today and the only instances of this occurring that I was able to find were with the AES and HINTEGRA ankle replacements and these seemed to have taken place at least several years ago. I have not found any reports of this condition with the Inbone ankle but I will ask my surgeon about this when I see him in three weeks."
"Regards,"
"Bruce"
"Dear Bruce"
"There is a lot of stuff about it out there especially in various research papers. surgeons are very reluctant to say anything about it...its as if it's a dirty secret."
"Please be fully aware of it's danger and make sure others are aware of it and directly ask at every check up to avoid being in the same situation as I'm now in."
"You can see how well I was doing at twenty weeks by googling Yogesh total ankle replacement. Let me know if that fails to bring it up please."
"Cheers Richard"
"Hi Tara. I'm also in CA and looking for a doctor for a TAR. It sounds like yours is successful. I saw one doc that wants to do the Infinity, and it sounds good, but it's hard to know where to research doctors. I feel like I need more information and a second opinion before taking the leap. It would be great to know where you are located or who your doctor is. I'm on the central coast of CA but would travel."
"Here in the UK there were about 800 TAR surgeries done last year by a large number of surgeons and I understand most surgeons only do less than five a year so are getting very little experience. This I gather leads to poorer results than should be the case and I bear witness to this and face a very uncertain outcome to try to find a solution to my failing prosthesis."
"This is a very technical, tricky and exacting surgery and I urge anyone going in for a TAR to be fully ware of this situation. It may be different in the US but I somehow doubt it!"
"Good luck. Richard"
"Hi, I had a STAR replacement on April 6th of this year by Dr. Thordarson at Cedars Sinai. No real pain, easy recovery. Non weight bearing for a month, followed by a month in a walking boot, and then... Walking, hiking, surfing, riding a bike... pretty much pain free. Amazing! Before the surgery I hadn't taken a pain free step in 7 years... it's not 100% but it's 90+% at this point, and I'll take that any day of the week. Good luck."
"I think he's probably the best ankle surgeon in the western U.S. What I did before surgery was ask a lot of Physical Therapist and other Docs who they'd recommend for a TAR and Thordarson seemed to be the one they all liked. Once again, good luck!"
"Hope this will help."
"I had TAR last week with Shannon Rush MD PAMF, El Camino Hospital in Mountain View. At 9 days out, things seem good: no blood, little pain, minimal antibiotics."
"I found Dr. Rush this way:"
"Went to a non surgical DO and got his opinion. I have had good experience with this DO in the past. He said Dr Rush was by far his first choice."
"I spent a lot of time on line and confirmed that Dr. Rush might be the best."
"My primary doc talked with Rush and said he seemed like the right guy."
"I talked with a guy in my golf club who had had TAR and he said Dr. Rush was great, and performed a successful surgery with him a year ago."
"I talked with my physical therapist and she said that she had worked with Dr. Rush's patients, and they were all positive about him."
"He is a pretty straightforward guy. Not chatty, but pleasant."
"I was in El Camino hospital for a night. Rush said that this is often done as an outpatient procedure."
"I have never used this forum before so I don't know if I will get notified if you ask another question. I may check back in a week or so."
"Mike"
"I'm now 3 months removed from surgery. As of last week I'm out of the boot and in sneakers and hiking boots. I've had no pain other than that associated with using muscles and tendons that haven't been used in 26 years. I'm now able to walk or slowly jog on a treadmill, hike, do squats and lunges with weights, etc. I should have full range of motion within the next 9 months. I'm ecstatic with the results so far."
"The surgery took place in Hendersonville TN USA. The device was the Infinity Inbone/Prophecy system. I had researched this for many years before deciding on the Inbone, Other patients reported very good results. The doc is Marc Tressler. He's performed more than 700 total ankle replacements over the years, I believe there are only 3 docs in the US who have performed more. There is more detail in my reply to shanda1980 from 25 days ago. Let me know if you have any questions."
"Dear Bruce"
"So glad that all went well for you. I'm interested to know if you were told about osteolysis before you had this surgery."
"I had a TAR in the UK five years and am having to have a revision next month due to osteolysis destroying the bones were the prosthesis is."
"The galling thing is that I had full mobility following the surgery and only minor discomfort in the following years and it was a year ago at my annual check up that it was found that I had a huge problem and it has taken all this time to get to a revision due to the complexity if the situation."
"There is a Youtube video showing me walking, and running up and down stairs at twenty weeks. If anyone is interested Google Yogesh total ankle replacement Kenward to get to it."
"My new surgeon who is very experienced would like to use the Infinity but since my bone quality has been badly compromised he is doubtful about how successful the revision will be."
"Osteolysis is something that can effect all artificial joints but it seems that TAR are much more likely to be effected."
"Cheers. Richard"
"Thank you so much for joining in and responding! I am so glad to hear of someone with a good outcome! I believe I had no other choice but to have an ankle replacement. I did not go with the inbone, although I did choose the infinity TAR. The surgeon was very pleased with the outcome and believes I will make a full recovery."
"My surgery was on the 23rd of August and I spent 3 days in the hospital for pain management and I developed a low grade fever."
"They wanted me to take 2--5mg OxyContin pills every 6 hours. There were times when I did need them but most of the time I only took 1 pill every 6 hours. Since addiction runs in my family, I was scared to keep taking them so I called and expressed this to my dr so he changed my pain meds to 1 Percocet 5 every 6 hours and I am doing fine with that, if I even need to take meds at all."
"My follow up is sept 14th and I will be getting out of the cast and getting stitches out. Hopefully I will be starting PT 3-4 days a week."
"At this point, I am very pleased. Barely any pain at all so far! I am very glad for your recovery as well! Many thoughts and prayers headed your way!"
"Bruce,"
"This is great news!!!! I am so happy for you, most people who never have had their ability to walk normally or live in pain, won't understand what a relief it is when you are finally able to be pain free!!!"
"I am 17 days out of surgery and the pain relief I feel is outstanding. I do have good and bad days, but the good days outweigh the bad by 90%! Although I have a long way before I can consider myself 100% again, I am very optimistic for my recovery so far! I go back on September 14th for my first follow up, they will take me out of the cast, remove my sutures, and hopefully place me in a boot, then set me up for Physical Therapy."
"I only need to take 1 Percocet 5mg when I wake up. The rest of the day, I am fine!"
"I am able to do housework, while sitting on my walker (which has a set and wheels). When I go outside to visit with my horses and pig, I'm in my wheelchair and I have no pain other than the occasional nerve pain in my toes, which I was told that is normal and will subside eventually, seeing the nerves, tendons, and muscles are healing."
"I wish there was a way to post pictures on this site. I would love to share with you what my ankle looked like after my initial injury back in 2013."
"If you would like to see it, you can email me and I can send it to you through email."
"I look forward to keeping up with your progression!!! Hearing your updates....make me feel very hopeful about my future progress!!!"
"Thank you & congrats on your progress thus far!!!!"

"Hi Shanda, I'm 38 and planning to have a TAR in the next few months, due to a 24 year old severe fracture that has resulted in end stage artheritis. The news that I had reached this stage was a shock, I'm obviously in a lot of pain and mobility has reduced steadily but still a shock to find how limited my options would be, especially still being relatively young and a single working mum, my life has changed dramatically and I know I have a lot to come. Reading your comments has filled me out th hope after being tearful for the last few weeks. So happy you seem to be recovering well!"

"Claire x"
"Hi Claire! I am truly sorry that it's come to the point where you have to have a TAR. Do you know which prosthetic they will be using?"
"Believe me, having a TAR, isn't necessarily a bad thing. I can tell you that deciding to have a TAR was the best decision of my life. My surgery was on August 23, 2017 and I honestly tell you that I am about 95-96% pain free! The first few days after the surgery was pretty rough, I won't lie to you. But as of today, this is the first time since my accident that I can say I'm almost pain free."
"I am starting physical therapy soon. Hopefully in 2 weeks, I will be able to start walking."
"If I may give you a little advice for a successful recovery..."
"1. Do exactly what your Dr says."
"2. DO NOT put any weight on it at all for at least 6 -8 weeks."
"3. When they take the cast off and put you into a boot....when you take the boot off, start rotating it slowly, don't force any movement."
"4. When your discharged from the hospital, continue elevating it. (I still keep mine elevated)"
"5. No matter what, do physical therapy for as long as you can. (It will hurt like hell, but the pain is only temporary but the outcome will be worth it!"
"Before my TAR, I was in constant severe pain to the point where it was debilitating. For me to be almost pain free.....I can't tell you how good it feels knowing I will have a better quality of life now! My dr even said that once I am completely 100% healed, I may even be able to jog (I was a runner), I will be able to ride and train horses again. I even know of a man who is able to snowboard after he healed from his TAR."
"I hope you have a successful surgery and recovery! This forum has helped me so much mentally and emotionally, going through this process. These people are amazing!!! If you have any questions or advice, we are here for you! If you want to keep in contact, you can send me your email through the private message feature on here!"
"Good luck!!"
"Shanda"
"Shanda, thank you so much for the advice and the kind words, I will take every bit of advice, I feel a million times better just hearing other people going through the same as me, I've been feeling so alone, it as if all the memories of my original accident at age 14 came back, struggling with constant pain and struggling to fit in and play down my disability. Yours and the others on this thread have given me courage and hope. I'm not sure what implant they will be using I see the surgeon on the 9th October so will post regular updates, all also PM you my email."
"Thank you ????"
"This forum and people really helped me as well. That's one thing your not, is alone! Not in here!"
"My surgeon used the infinity prosthetic on me. I did a lot of research on different ones. It may help you to do some research on different TAR prosthetics. Google TAR prosthetic. One that is popular and has a good success rate is the inbone. You can look up star, infinity, inbone, invision, and prophecy. Hope that helps a little bit to get you started!"
"It always pays to do your research before you see your surgeon."
"Here in the UK a large number of surgeons do very few each year which is very bad for many patients because they are likely to have a much worse outcome than they expect. Happened to me."
"Cheers, Richard"
"Thanks so much for your information. I called the office of Dr. Rush and was told that they don't keep track of how many TARS they have done or the success rate. That seemed a little odd to me. I thought that was a standard question from someone considering that type of surgery. I'm still looking for a doctor in the Bay Area in California or someplace within driving distance. I'm in the Santa Cruz area and saw Dr. Abidi but I'm not feeling very optimistic about proceeding with that office."
"HI Mike,"
"I'm strongly considering a STAR ankle replacement with Dr Rush, as well. I'm just checking in with you to see how it is progressing now that you're a few months out of surgery. Any information on your progress and if you feel it was the right decision would be very helpful. Thanks."
"--dan"
"Sounds very odd and not very professional. I would avoid any surgeon who did not keep a record of his/her surgeries. Here in the a UK I think it is a requirement of all surgeons which makes it an easier job when choosing a surgeon."
"Cheers Richard"
"Choosing to run after a TAR or similar surgery seems to me to be a very bad idea unless the aim is to have it fail early! Same goes for hips."
"Cheers Richard"
"Regards,"
"Bruce"
"Cheers Richard"
"Maybe I exaggerated a little bit. My ""jog"" was very, very slow. Just slightly faster than a fast walk. I did that for a few sessions at the gym but it wasn't comfortable. So now I just use an elliptical machine where I don't need to concern myself with my balance or my stride."
"Regards,"
"Bruce"
"I am in the same similar situation but Drs. I've seen aren't helpful. What Dr. Did your TAR?"
"Please check out their experience with that prosthesis and their level of successful outcomes."
"My TAR five years ago by a surgeon with limited experience needs to be revised now and because he set it badly off centre it will be a messy job . Probably due to this the bone has developed osteolysis which increases the difficulties."
"Ankle replacement surgery is a very exacting difficult surgery and it needs to be got right first time or the implications are likely to be devastating ."
"Good luck, Richard"
"Jan,"
"I would like to echo what Richard wrote. Ankle replacement is much different than knee or hip. Compared to hip or knee, the foot is more complex structure consisting of many joints, TAR is a much more recently developed procedure, TAR is a much more complex procedure to perform, and surgeons in general have much less experience performing them. I had my right done 11/1/16 and my left done 12/1/17. It took me 2 years to make the final decision to have the first one done, and consulted several ankle surgeons in several major referral centers in the NE until I made my decision. I waited each time until I simply could not walk due to the pain, and I lead a very active lifestyle as a golfer and sailor. I am very satisfied with the results, and hope to get back this spring to walking the golf course and sailing my boat on Lake Ontario."
"The local surgeon here in Syracuse planned to use the Inbone prosthesis, which other surgeons seem to feel is better reserved for re-do's. The local surgeon in my opinion had not done enough of them to make me comfortable. A surgeon in Mass General in Boston I saw was clearly very experienced and capable, but I did not want to travel 6 hours for each appointment. I found a highly regarded surgeon in Rochester, 1.5 hours away who was well published and past president of the American Society of Foot and Ankle surgeons and she referred me to a colleague who was in his 40's and doing quite a few TAR's over several years. Driving 1.5 hours each way for post op apts is not easy, but is doable, especially considering we can have lake effect blizzards daily, and has not been a major problem, but I would not want to have to go back and forth to Buffalo, Boston, or NYC for the post op visits."
"In addition to the ankle pain, before my right TAR in 2016, I was also experiencing a lot of heel pain. The local surgeon felt my heel pain represented plantar fasciitis, but I was not convinced. He kept giving me steroid injections into the ankle and wanted to inject the plantar fascia as well, which I did not agree to. The surgeon who eventually did my TAR, more carefully examined me and suggested that my heel pain was actually secondary to subtalar joint arthritis, not plantar fasciitis, and suggested a right subtalar joint fusion in addition to TAR. It turned out he was right on target. The subtalar fusion takes a long time to heal (a full year) compared to the TAR, but I would have continued with crippling pain from the subtalar arthritis had I not had the subtalar fusion."
"I would also like to state that it is my opinion that the steroid injections destroyed my ankle joint over the year that I had 3-4 of them. It is my understanding that steroid injections can hasten the process of degenerative arthritis, and my current surgeon states that it is the general consensus nationally that no ankle injects should be given to anyone."
"Each surgeon has his/her own preference for prosthesis, and I think the key is how much experience each has doing the procedure. I suggest asking straightforwardly, ""how many have your done, and how many with this prosthesis, how many complications have you seen and what kind of complications?"" Get a recommendation from a local general orthopedist if you have such a relationship. Ask your PCP help in finding someone. Get as many opinions from various foot and ankle surgeons or podiatrists that you can until you are comfortable with your decision. Bring a friend, spouse or significant other with you to each apt for a second set of eyes and ears."
"If one correctly by an experienced ankle surgeon or podiatrist, one has a good chance of success with TAR. Having it done by an inexperienced surgeon may potentially increase your risk of complications."
"Dear James"
"You are 100% correct. Here in the UK where I live many surgeons are doing very few ankle replacements which leads to many poor outcomes. It is almost as if they feel that it is important to be able to list it on their CV. This is IMO very unfair and costs our National Health Service a huge amount in revision surgery."
"I would like to make people aware of a big danger surgeons usually fail to talk about when setting out the risks attached to this surgery!"
"It is Osteolysis. This is bone degeneration caused by cysts in the bone and is thought to be caused by the interaction of the wear debris generated by the new joint causing a reaction that ones body cannot cope with."
"The body can usually deal with a small amount of this debris but if the joint is badly set the amount of wear debris is potentially going to be very much higher as in my case and being very active too simply increases the risk!"
"I've been trying to get my TAR revised for over a year and am now happy with the surgeon I've selected and his proposed plan of action. This just should not have happened."
"Members may be be interested in seeing a short video of me walking up and down a slope and trotting up and down a flight of stairs at twenty weeks post op. You will understand why I feel so gutted at the subsequent failure of my prosthesis! For anyone interested just Google yogesh total ankle replacement kenward."
"Please do not be put off having this amazing surgery but do go into it with both eyes open and find a really experienced surgeon. Dies not matter a jot if you like or dislike them as you are the one who will ha e to live with the consequences of the surgery for the rest of your life."
"Cheers Richard"
"Dr. Sam Flemister did the surgery. I first saw in Rochester Dr Judy Baumhauer, who is past president of the American Society for Foot and Ankle surgery, and very highly thought of nationally, and she said she was mostly doing research now and not doing as many TAR's, and suggested I see Dr Flemister. I have been very happy with Dr. Flemister. I also consulted Dr DiGiovanni at Mass General, who has done a ton of TAR's, who recommended Dr Flemister as well, since I did not want to wait 8-10 months to get on Dr DiGiovanni's schedule and also did not want to have to drive 5-6 hours to appointments. I saw a local Syracuse surgeon a few times and decided for several reasons to not have him do the surgery. I didn't think he had done enough of them, he was going to use the Inbone prosthesis, which seems huge to me, and he did not correctly diagnose the heel pain I was having (he thought it was secondary plantar fasciitis, when it turned out to be secondary to subtalar joint arthritis). The local doctor also gave me a series of steroid injections which I feel hastened the destruction of the joint."
"Many thanks for your prompt response. I met with Sam Flemister this week and he concurs with another orthopaedic surgeon - TAR is my only option. May I ask, and please be direct, what is the pain level after surgery. I'll hop, roll, jump do whatever is needed to recover but would like to 'program' myself for post surgical pain. Flemister seems to be the surgeon who has the most experience in this area."
"I had an TAR with an Infinity device on June 9 of 2017. Everyone's pain tolerance is unique, each surgeon is unique, and each ankle is unique. Having said that I can tell you that I had virtually no pain after surgery. They did a spinal block on Friday the day of surgery which was to last 24 hours. I had some discomfort at 9 AM the next day so I took an Oxycodon-Acetaminoohen 7.5 - 325 to ""stay on top of the pain"". I took 3 pills that day and 1 at 2:00 AM the next morning. When I woke up later that morning I realized I had only mild pain which was no worse than what I had lived with for 26 years while trying to decide what TAR and surgeon to choose. I took 2 pills during the day and 1 just prior to going to bed. After that I took 1 pill each night for about a week just to help me sleep. I'm now 7 months out and I couldn't be happier. Maybe my story is unusual but I firmly believe the surgeon and TAR model you choose make a huge difference. I've been all over the east coast over the years getting opinions from John Hopkins in Baltimore, the Hospital for Special Surgery in NY, etc. The surgeon I used just outside of Nashville has performed over 800 of these operations."
"Best of luck and keep us posted."
"800 surgeries is remarkable! I investigated going out of area to have the surgery, but so many expenses would not be covered by my insurance if I did so. I have a pretty high tolerance with pain, and like you said, compared to the grinding we've lived with, a few uncomfortable days is well worth it. Thank you for responding. I'm leaning towards going with the most experience surgeon in Rochester NY."
"thanks, Mike"
"Yes. Dr. Marc Tressler. It's been awesome, a life changing experience. No more pain and after 7 months I don't even think about my ankle."
"Yes, there are only a few surgeons in the US who have performed more of these surgeries. I would definitely recommend checking the experience level of your surgeon. I chose the Infinity because with that TAR the placement of the new ankle is for the most part taken out of the surgeons hands with a device they call the Prophecy. I've read so many horror stories in this blog regarding improper placement of the TARs. Good luck to you!"
"Dear Bruce"
"I very much support the premise that it is far too critical a surgery to be done by anyone than by a really experienced surgeon with lots of successful ankle replacement surgeries under their belts. As a result of a poor ankle replacement surgery some years ago I am waiting for what is likely to be a difficult revision so I'm speaking from bitter experience."
"Cheers, Richard"
"Dr Flemister is moderately experienced. There are doctors who have done more, but I think he has done enough to do a reliably good job. There is a doctor in Buffalo who has done several hundred, but I never consulted him. Dr Flemister is very down to earth and caring. He communicated directly with me via their portal messaging system when I needed. His office staff were very responsive to my needs as well. When I had a difference of opinion or questions about a direction we were going, he was very willing to discuss the issues openly, and review medical literature I sent him. I have no qualms about his care."
"Regarding post op pain: I had two divergent experiences. At my 2016 surgery, I had both a right TAR and a right subtalar fusion. I was given a nerve block and was told I would awaken from anesthesia without pain, and that the block would last about 24 hours. Unfortunately, I woke up in agony because the nerve block did not take. The pain was major for over 2 weeks, and it continued until almost a year after the surgery. However, I was able to enjoy sailing Lake Ontario and golf over the spring and summer (had to take a cart, could not hoof it), and took tylenol for the pain. I believe my abnormal gait from my other (left) ankle made my recovery from the right more prolonged."
"When I had the left TAR done in 12/17, my experience was the opposite. The nerve block was fabulous and lasted 36 hours. It was still in effect when I left the hospital. I didn't take my first pain med until I was home, and then only needed it for less than 2 weeks. The first week was the worst. I did not need the subtalar fusion for the left, and I think that played a role in having an easier time a year later with the left TAR. I do not regret having the right subtalar fusion, because the right subtalar joint was severely arthritic and was a major component of my right ankle pain prior to surgery."
"I had some minor delayed wound healing with both procedures, but it eventually worked out."
"The most difficult part of the recovery for me was not the pain, but the 6 weeks of non weight bearing. TAR's are different from total knee and hip because they do not use cement. The bone has to grow into the prosthesis, which takes 6+ weeks. Because they cement the knees and hips, one can walk immediately post-op knee and hip as soon as the anesthesia wears off, but not so with ankles."
"My words of advice are to take the nerve block (usually they work), keep your leg strictly elevated post op for the 6 weeks (reduces swelling and therefore reduces pain and promotes wound healing), do as much upper body exercise as you can to keep yourself sane (dumbbells, weight machine, stretch bands, etc), take the pain meds liberally as needed the first couple of weeks then switch to tylenol (barring any personal contraindications), ice pack the ankle for at least the first week or so15 minutes every 4 hours, (I suggest a Chattenooga cold pack"

"and be patient, and be patient, and be more patient. You will get frustrated, but be kind to your care givers. The 6 weeks seems like forever when you are going through it, but it passes. I found a knee walker to be great. I actually used it to go to basketball games at the Carrier Dome."
"Both times I was walking at 6 weeks with minimal discomfort. Dr Flemister preferred I continue using the post op boot for a month after starting weight bearing, but I could not because walking with the boot aggravated other joint problems (knees and hips)."
"Overall, I have no regrets for having had these procedures, and I am very grateful for the excellent medical care I received from Dr Flemister and his team. I would be in a wheelchair had it not been for his magical hands."

"I had the Wright In Bone TAR a little over 11 months ago. I can honestly say I have no pain, but I still have a lot of numbness. My two big toes and the bottom of my foot are numb. I am 66 years old and live in Eugene, Oregon. Nicholas Strasser was my surgeon and I believe he did a fine job, If the bottom of my foot gets bumped I will experience discomfort. It's like the nerve is there but just out of whack. The surgeon had to move the nerve in order to clean out the arthritis and he has told me that it could take a year or more for feeling to come back. Does anyone else have experience with numbness? I really don't have much of the prickly pin cushion sensations but I will feel little jolts of sensation every once in a while. I'd be interested in knowing if others have experiences this and if their feeling came back. Thanks!"
"John"
"Hi John. I never had numbness but I did have what felt like little jolts of electricity on the left side of my ankle. I had a large amount of scar tissue in that spot from my original accident. I believe the tingling was a result of the scar tissue breaking up as I regained movement in that area. It happened occasionally for about 4 months. I'm now 7 months in and have not had any recent occurrences."
"Possibly your jolts of sensation is just part of the healing process. Good luck."
"Bruce"
"I did not experience this with either of my TAR's"
"Wish I would have found this blog a few years ago, but that is moot at this point. I am about 7 weeks PO of what I so far feel is excellent procedure, but I've been looking to see if anyone else has had the following."
"Operation (TAR) went well with everyone involved pleased. Nerve block seemed to have lasted far longer than I expected. Stopped Percocet a day or two before prescription ran out as there really and still isn't any pain. Uncomfortable but no pain till day stitches removed. I've had stitches many times in my 67 years, but the last three (closest to top of foot) brought me to tears and looking for that stick to clench in my teeth like some old western movie. Since then I have had random shocks, burning sensations, and aches that are just enough to wake me up just as I fall asleep. I was hoping to find more references to this, but you seem to come the closest. No mess seem to effect this what so ever (Percocet, Flavil, over the counter anything, etc.). I think surgeon, post op nurse, and everyone else believes this is temporary and I'm hoping. Just wondering if you've heard or experienced anything similar."
"Thanks for any consideration. I still think the operation is todate a success and I'm pleased with surgeon et all, just wondering why my symptoms aren't mentioned."
"Kenneth, I am 11 weeks out. I have at time experienced a burning pain at the top of my incision. It lasts a few minutes and goes away. I attributed it to reaction to the suture material (don't know if this is correct or not). The burning is not as severe as what you describe, and has lessened in intensity as time goes on. Hope this is helpful"
"John I had mine done almost 4 months ago and my foot, toes, top of foot and lower leg still feel asleep! I did not have a nerve block. I am being told this is normal and may take up to a year. My swelling is pretty bad as well and that is the hardest part adding to my toes being numb, it is like going to the dentist and getting Novocain and feeling like your tongue and lips are swollen but really aren't, where in this case they are! My heal has been awake since almost the beginning and about a month ago I started feeling like I was stepping on tacks just in the middle of my foot that has not stopped or changed in anyway! I do have pain and discomfort everywhere in the area of the surgery. I have gotten more stiff lately and my range of motion and gone backwards too. So you are not alone!"
"Good Luck to you! My best suggestion would be to make sure you are mentally prepared for this! It may turn out to be more than a few uncomfortable days for you! I did not have the nerve block and the pain really wasn't too bad once I was home. As long as I didn't let my leg hang down! Always keep it propped way above your heart when sitting or laying! Listen to your surgeon when it comes to your incision! If not prescribed get some 15-20 compression socks when you can start wearing them to help with the swelling. Ice as much as you can! That being said, I'm 4 months out and I am regretting doing this each and every day now! I still cannot feel my foot/toes/lower leg, my swelling is horrible and my PT just cut me off after only 2 months because I'm not getting any better. My range of motion is not where it needs to be either. Yesterday I went to get a second opinion and the Dr. said ""I can see you were not prepared for this nor given all the information upfront"" and I guess I wasn't. Everybody is different but the dangers are the same for us all! Oh and don't let me forget this, my insurance company didn't pay my surgeon, they said it was not medically necessary because I did not meet the criteria. So that is another thing to make sure of. Just because it may be a covered benefit does not mean that they will pay for it!"
"Shelly, it has been 13 months since my surgery. I came out of the surgery with numbness in my two big toes the top of the foot and the bottom of my foot. I had tingly sensations for the first month or two. I really have not had pain since the first 10 days or so. I just have a foot that feels like a half a block of cement. Still have some swelling but I'm able to play golf 3 days a week and have no pain. The biggest thing is that I'm aware all the time that the ankle and foot do not feel normal. I just had a complete nuerological workup and the neurologist told me not to expect getting feeling back at this point. He said it was possible but not likely. So this is my new normal. I don't have the pain I used to have which is great but I'm always flexing my foot to see if the numbness is still there. I do have feeling but it's out of whack. If I were to bump the bottom of my foot it would hurt or if I have flushed my toe up against a baseboard I wouldn't know it till after a lengthy period of time and then I would feel it. All in All, I would do the operation again. I walk much better than I used to. Hang in there and hopefully you will progress in all areas."
"A short update. The surgery was carried out six weeks ago and appears to have gone well. The surgery took six hours and for protection I was on an antibiotic drip for ten days."
"Very little pain but totally shattered looking after myself at home. Now at six week feeling much stronger and capable."
"Been allowed partial and increasing partial weight bearing in the last few days but think that I may have set my recovery back because I'm now getting a little bit of pain and twinges."
"Another follow up visit to hospital next week so hopefully nothing horrible will be found!"
"Cheers Richard"
"​I am headed for the Infinity replacement and worried. I have a bunion on the same foot and bad feet to start with broke my ankle 2 years ago and arthritis now there and getting worse. How bad were the first few weeks and months after he TAR ? I see so much bad news from so many that I fear I may be worse of if I do this Infinity TAR and searching for anyone for advice to see if it is even worth doing ?"
"Hi Richard,"
"I have been reading your comments and the last one was 6 months ago. I do hope that by now your ankle is much better and you have not had to go through any revision surgery. I have just had an ankle arthroscopy at the RJAH Hospital near Oswestry with Mr. Andrew Bing. They were going to also do a foot correction due to no arches left, but abandoned this as they found I have no cartilage left, and therefore have final stage post traumatic arthritis. Mr. Bing has already done around 80 replacements and I found him via a previous patients whose replacement was very successful. My two options now are a fusion or a replacement. Can't have a fusion as my other ankle is not good either and I had CRPS very badly following a break. So, my only choice is a replacement. After the arthroscopy op, Mr. Bing said that I might not feel too much pain walking and this could last for 3 days, 3 weeks or even 3 years. Not sure at this stage how I will fare, as I am only in my 2nd weeks of recovery. I would really like to have the op soon and get on his waiting list, but having read all the comments above, I am not so sure."
"I am doing a lot of research and will ask him all the questions you suggested. Could you please let me know where and who did your replacement and have you heard of this hospital? I can only say good things about the care and this surgeon."
"Thank you very much for your response."
"Update for anyone who may be interested."
"OK, the revision surgery was on February 26th and I've made a fantastic recovery in the opinion of the surgeon. I have tried to be sensible and I started back to swimming as soon as my incision had fully healed about three months ago and go five days a week and swim for about ninety minutes."
"I was asked not to use my legs so as to avoid the danger of pumping fluid into where the surgeon had to repair a large cyst resulting from the original TAR which caused the trouble."
"I've started using my legs now for swimming but not all of the time as I was told to increase the use. Of course I overdid it and had to rest my ankle for several days but t did not prevent me from moving about."
"I've been back to full exercising for a couple of weeks and have walked up to four miles in one day with no ill effects, just slight tiredness in the ankle. Sometimes it feels a bit tender alost the feeling one gets from a bruise but it does not feel sensitive when squeezed."
"My gait is excellent and nobody would be able to tell that I have had a TAR. My stride length, and speed of walking is very good and I can keep up with guys half my age so I'm pretty happy."
"If anyone would like to talk on the phone about it then please message me. I am not prepared to try to do it by email as firstly I'm not fast on the keyboard and secondly you will get much more benefit from having a discussion. Just send me a message."
"Cheers Richard"
"I've just sent you my phone number. Cheers Richard"
"Dear all"
"Please call. If I don't pick up can you please leave me a voice mail and I will call you back"
"I need to talk to anyone who has either done a TAR or will be"
"Thanks.....David"
"Moderator comment: I have removed the phone number as we do not publish these in the forums. If users wish to exchange contact details please use the Private Message service."
"please can you tell me which surgeon you are now seeing many thanks"
"Hi Ellie,"
"to date, I have had an ankle arthroscopy 6 weeks ago at the RJAH Orthopaedic Hospital in Oswestry under Mr. Andrew Bing. Once they had done the debridement, it was found that I had no cartilage at all left, so will need a TAR. I researched very carefully for a surgeon who had already done a number of TAR's and Mr. Bing , I believe, has done some 70 TAR operations to date. I think he is brilliant and I would not go anywhere else, even though I live 2 1/2 hours away from this specialist hospital. I can't really comment on any other hospitals or surgeons, but you can research on the following website for specialists in ankle replacements."
"Good luck with your research and ask your doctor to refer you to the surgeon of your choice on the NHS."
"Let me know how you get on. Inge"
"thank you so much i live in central london , mr BINGS SECRETARY RECOMMENDED mr andrew goldberg in london . that just confirmed what i had been told . has anybody ever had surgery under mr andrew goldberg ??"
"Dear David"
"I also need a TAR and just deciding which surgeon to use < very tricky ?"
"Mr Bing recommended Mr Andrew Goldberg in london ."
"I see this post is 5 years old. How are you doing, these days. I am end stage on my ankle, but I can walk in 1 1/2"" wedge shoes most days."
"I only get about 30 minutes to an hour on my feet with rests inbetween."
"Was your doctor very experienced with TAR? I have seen 4 surgeon DPMs, young and not too experienced. One is 45 and more experienced, but I just don't believe the amount he says he has performed. 'Trust, but verify'."
"I am 69 and pretty fit, considering I shattered my ankle 47 years ago."
"I hope you see this and respond with good news."
"If I wait much longer, it may result in amputation as there are MANY subchondral defects (sacs filled with fluid)..."
"Thank you, in advance."
"Warm Regards,"
"Viki"
"Hi Viki"
"Thank you for the message."
"How am I doing these days... well it's been 5 years that I have had the TAR and if I compare to what I had before the TAR, I must say it was a worthwhile 5 years because I have had much less pain and more mobility than what I had before the TAR. Was my doctor experienced?. One must look at that in terms of how experienced the doctor was with the specific prosthesis and the procedure attached to that specific prostheses. In that regard, I heard after the operation that I was number two in Africa to receive that specific prosthesis so I guess he was not experienced enough but he still did a pretty good job. I was unlucky with the after-care and the healing process took longer than I anticipated so it could have been a much better outcome, was I aware of it."
"That said, at the moment I am struggling with a stress fracture of my Fibula close to the TAR and I have to wear a Moon boot for 6 weeks. The prothesis moved and the alignment is putting stress on my Fibula, to such an extend that it caused a stress fracture now. Apart from that also, I was told that the prosthesis is pretty loose and will eventually work it's way up the bone and that can cause huge damage to the bone...possibly split it etc. I can still walk on it with relatively low pain and movement of my foot and when I lie down, it is totally painless....very normal movement etc."
"In my case I really have two busted ankles and also very worn out shoulders...at 57 ...not a joke. So I have to be very careful what my next move have to be becasue I can not walk too far on crouches either. I currently have appointments with two surgeons. The one who did my TAR 5 years ago and the other is to my knowledge the most experienced and specialized ankle surgeon in my country. I have been to both in the past also. I need to find out what has perhaps happened in the last 5 years in terms of TAR revision etc. so that I can plot a way forward for my replaced ankle. Maybe there is also for me a bit of good news?. The other one will have to be fused, but not a complete fusion, only one of the three joints. Depending on what I come back with after my visit, I will have to make calls and plot my course of action going forward. I am very sick and tired of not being able to do things I want to do as a normal person and also of cutting back on my quality of life all the time. One has to get yourself up-and-running - figuratively speaking, as soon as possible."
"I am not against TAR at all. If a revision can be done with maybe a prosthesis that has a more sturdy method of fixation etc. I will have to consider it because I already have a hollowed out hole with a loose prosthesis in it currently. Taking it out and filling that gap is another longtime uncomfortable process, unless it can be filled with another prosthesis and that is why I have to consider revision surgery for that ankle."
"I have just spoken to a friend of mine who had both his ankles fused after they were crushed in a parachuting accident in 1986. Now, 30+ years later only things he complains about is the occasional cold winter pains and a bit of arthritis. If I knew him 5 years ago, I might have gone the fusion route instead because I was under the impression that walking with two ""stiff"" ankles will be very hard, which is in fact not the case."
"I have learned that each ankle case is unique because there are other factors e.g cysts and like in your case other sub-cordial defects etc.. Each one has to be judged on it's own merits and age does also play a role, as does levels of activity. I am actually much in the same boat as you in that regard, but I have two of them little buggers to worry about😒. If I were you, I would seriously consider ankle arthrodesis and not TAR. Chances of complications with TAR is just too high and once you have a TAR, ankle arthrodesis afterwards becomes much riskier and hard to perform due to loss of bone tissue. Don't let them tell you that ankle arthrodesis is still an option if TAR fails....it is not that simple. To have that fixed can literally take a year or more. Age and healing of bones etc. is also in your case perhaps more of a factor than in mine, but you will have to talk to an experienced medical practitioner about the options. Also lots of information on the internet. Just remember whatever you decide, after-care and complete healing is the number one factor for success. To accomplish that, you have to be manic about letting your ankle heal 100% completely before you put weight on it. I am serious, you can sort out any stiffness etc. afterwards but just let that thing heal completely. To give your body the best chance of healing, you have to abide by the rules of good healthy living by eating healthy food and to absolutely NOT smoke any tobacco. (Smoking retards bone growth up to 2.7 fold)"
"I will report back when I have more clarity on my position end of this month and I wish you all the best Viki. Please let me know what is happening on your side also. One has to prevent amputation at all cost, I believe, but when it comes to a certain point in ones life, it may be the best option to regain the joy of life you may have had to give up due to the condition of your ankle. I will however explore all possible options before I settle for amputation though."
"Regards"
"LDT:"
"Thank you for your in-depth reply. Fortunately, I've eaten organic for forty years. Though I smoke loose organic roll your own cigarettes, I have to stop. I use systemic enzymes and understand horsetail herb promotes bone healing. It us the time of healing that gets me, but am so glad you do not regret yours."
"Take care."
"I look forward to your rrply. God Speed."

"Was your TAR an inbone? I don't qualify for the Star or any regular TARs."

"Hi"
"I had the Zimmer Trabecular TAR done in 2014."
"In the past I have taken a look at the in-bone system and I guess it may well be the only possible option for me, as far as a ""revision"" of my TAR is concerned. Not sure if it is done in my country but I will certainly ask the question end of this month. It seems to me like the only TAR that has the strength and agility to hold up to the forces at play in an ankle."
"Regards"
"I would like to estabish contact with anyone who has undergone ankle replacement surgery and reflect a ittle on the aftereffects and the longer term prognoses for recovery and mobility."
"Having undergone such an operation about 9 months ago I am currently coming to terms with a less than welcome (and certainly unexpected) imapct upon my life and mobility."
"Issues such as lack of mobility, excessive swelling and cronic pain from the ankle itself but also from the toes and lack of sensation and feeling in parts of the foot are those I am facing and would like to know how other poeple have fared, both in the short and longer term."

"I'm 20 years old and six weeks post op from a total ankle replacement. So far I feel great, going to physical therapy three times a week to begin regaining motion. Ive have 4 surgeries in the past so my tendons and entire ankle area are extremely stiff from all of the trauma and scarring. I see small improvements at physio everytime I go and am very optimistic about the future. I got the TAR because my RA destroyed all of my ankle cartilage leaving me with bone on bone grinding. Most of that pain is now gone, just very sore from the ROM exercises."
"A decent part of my foot is still numb, those who have had this surgery...has your sensation come back yet?"
"I am jumping into this conversation after lurking on the site for a few months. I had TAR almost 9 months ago in Boston using the STAR device. I am beyond delighted with the results. I have essentially no ankle pain (less than my 60-year old still-original and much-used left ankle) and have been able to return to all activities, save running. I avoid running only because of the admonition of my doctor not because it is uncomfortable in any way. Regarding numbness, I suppose 6 weeks out from the surgery I still felt some nerve trauma from the major operation but for months now I feel that all sensation has returned to my foot. My only concern at this point is finding a balance between living my physical life to the fullest and trying to make sure that I don't hurt this joint and require another surgery. It seems pretty bulletproof at this point with hiking and farm work being the things that I do that stress it the most."
"Goog movement and nearly the same as my good ankle , no pain sitting or lying down BUT walking thats another story. I would say pain 6 0ut 0f 10 prior to op and 7 out of 10 now.. I am told that prior to the op my ankle would get worse over time but with the op i would get better or stay the same."
"I look forward ever day to improvement and back to a full walking situation."
"I must admit i have just ordered a an electric scooter just in case i dont get any better."
"Regards Mr Ankle"
"Movement of the joint itself is very limited compared to my other foot if I point my toes downward but almost the same on pulling them up towards me as far as I can. Advice from a recent physio session was useless and a waste of time."
"There is a dull ache most of the time and plenty of numbness still but I am cautiously optimistic. Most of the stories here full me with alarm and I feel very sorry for those who are struggling."
"Glad to her that your operation appears to be a success. I had my TAR about 4 months ago and generally I'm good. I came to terms along time ago before the final decision to have ankle replacement that I would never be able to run again, do high impact exercise or contact sport."
"But having said that I can now walk for about ten minutes straight without any pain or discomfort, longer walks I take fold-away stick with me. My surgeon said that it will take at least tweleve months to ""fully heal"" so I as far as I am concerned I am on the right track. I finish my course of hydro therapy which has been so helpful today and then revert back to normal PT probably for about a month maybe two depending on how `i get on."
"The only real annoyance I found was the numbness and loss of sensation in my foot on my left hadn side from my big toe to the back of me foot (I'd already lost sensation in the back of my heal the last time I had my final Laparoscopy)"
"But I guess given the trauma that your surrounding muscles, tendons and arties and veins are put through during surgey some loss of sensation is bound to occur."
"I massage my scar daily which helps a lot too and exercise as much as I can flexing my foot pointing my toes using escalators to hang my heels over the edge and stretch and using stairs as much as possible. Each person is different for me it's be the best thing though I have been warned that it is possible I may experience the same scenario in my left ankle but will cross that bridge if and when it occurs"
"Keep going - do the ankle foot exercises start of with a towel around the ball of the foot hold on to the ends with your hands to create resistance and push the towel away from you and downwards with"
"Similalry when seated gently take hold of you ankle - crtoss your leg over with your ankle on its side sole of your foot faceing away from you and gently push the ankle and foot to point your toe"
"I'm constantly doing ""exercises"" when I do stuff standing in a lift I will rise up on the balls of my feet trying to make sure that my weight ie evenly spread for a count of ten and then slowly lower to a count of ten you can do this practicly anywhere it's small things that you can do step up and off using your good leg a counter weight so if you have an exercise step at home then you can do this one but make sure you can place the step somewhere where you have support. If you have a house with a landing and a banister then do it on the landing using the banister for support. So with your operated ankle step onto the step, then swing your good leg through and touch the toe of your ankle/leg onto the floor and then swing the good leg back through."
"I also found that running warm water over my ankle helps too"
"Best of with your continuing recovery"
"Lucy"
"I am approaching my 9th month since my left TAR, and reading what you describe about your case I find lots of similarities with my own case. Numbness to the big toe and back of the ankle is a mostly match, but like you I have a history of operations. I also had to come to terms with the possibility of never run again, although the thought still scares me because I never quite know how I can ""save myself"" in an emergency situation. I recall a time that I was caught in the middle of a lightening storm in the open, unable to run for cover, all I could do was fast pace myself, keeping all my fingers crossed. Another less frightening situation, but similarly stressful to me, is when I need to rush between flights in complex (an long lines waiting) airport systems. In times like that I feel quite inadequate for not being able to run - which I forgot how to do!"
"I do work on my mobility though, I am currently doing PT at the hospital and have to kick myself off my office desk to do streching excercises during the day. I feel that everytime I exercise my walking becomes less cumbersome, but if I sit down for too long the swelling and stiffness exacerbate. The ""cure"" is to keep your movement, you already do that. As for the numbness, well, we just need to cope."
"Regards,"
"Gilbert"
"I hear you. We just have to keep on going and at the moment the progress that I'm making maybe slow but the ankle situation is a dam sight better than it was prior to my ankle op."
"Wishing you all the best and hoping that the numbeness lessen as each month goes by"
"Regards"
"Lucy"
"I am unable to advise you but am interested in your situation. I had a pretty major accident almost a year ago (hit by a car whilst out running!) - I've healed very well but have the same issue with one of my ankles. my consultant says im a good candidiate for both TAR and fusion but is trying to steer me towards fusion which i dont want. Did you face the same issue? How did you decide to go with TAR?"
"Having had many ops on both my ankles, i have had ongoing issues with numbness in both feet. Whilst I cannot relate to your particular op, I do find that the numbness fades eventually - it took 11 months for one foot and my other is still numb in part following an invasive op 5 months ago...not sure if this helps!!"
"What's life like after TAR? Im interested in your story because you're young as am i. Would snowboarding be out of the question? Im pretty active, snowboarding, running, gym and work on my feet."
"Any insight would be helpful"
"Thank you"
"Sal"
"I had a TAR in 2014 and all went well for a year and then it started to become loose. Had a CT scan 3 days ago. The prosthesis appears to be loose, has subsided and tilted and there are bone cysts forming in the talus bone and needs to be removed. The main reason why I had a TAR was because I am relatively young and wanted to live my normal life. Only afterwards, I found out that TAR is something that only older people should consider, just the opposite of what my impression was at the time."
"A fusion usually is only one of the three joints in the ankle and you can have a pretty normal life after it. My TAR was done by a top surgeon, all was great (see my posts here) but somehow it just started to push up into the bone (I am 100% in shape for my height). It's not nice to have to go for more surgery now and to be honest, it could all have been avoided if I knew what (or how small) the impact was of fusion. For me at the time it meant something which I felt I would not have been able to live with. Today, retrospect, it would have been a breeze walking with only one little stiff joint that can not break loose, instead of now having to face a possible stiff foot plus a leg that is 3cm shorter than the other."
"Also remember, once you had TAR and things do go wrong, like in my case, a fusion of the one joint becomes extremely challenging and somewhat unlikely and that is not a position you want to find yourself in. A removed TAR prosthesis leave a huge hole in the bone that needs to filled up or completely cut out. Please do your homework, there are more TAR cases that went wrong than success stories and you can by no means judge a TAR on only a year. Mine was fine after a year and shortly after that the trouble started."
"Please don’t get me wrong, I am not opposed to TAR but I am definitely of the opinion that TAR is on the long term, not suited for an active lifestyle and should only be considered for older less active people."
"Regards"
"Leon"
"I reply to you after the reply you received from LDT. I must agree (with Leon) that a person with an active life style - regardless of age - should consider TAR with great caution, for the risk to have issues in the near future after the procedure will be likely higher. With that being said, it seems to me that a person like you, who appear to want to keep the same physical activities, would most likely have problems, and that is all the logic to it."
"In my case, I am now 1 year 1 month after my TAR, still fairly young (60) and active, I have few things to say: 1- the procedure Works! provided you have the best surgeon available to do it technically and scientifically; 2- the patient MUST do a good follow up post-surgery, doing ONLY recommended exercises (I would rule out snowboarding, for instance) for the duration of recovery, which might take a whole year or more; and 3- patient shall not be naive to expect 100% return to what he/she considered 'normal' life activities after a TAR (I, for instance, used to practice karate, I cannot see myself kicking a punch bag, or a person, again, ever) but instead should accept the new reality and adapt to it with new activities - don't see that as loosing all but as achieving new fun things in life that you never considered before, you'd be surprised...I am now coming to terms with just 'walking normal' again, it is still a challenge, every day I do stretching exercises for my foot and leg tendons - those are the real culprits for pain and stiffness you feel after the procedure - and walk at least a mile. I do not hold any hope to run again, although I am setting a goal to be able to at least sprint in case of an emergency."
"The bottom line (for me, at least) is, as I always say in this forum, every case is a case, and each will certainly have different results after the TAR intervention, some will be good and others, unfortunately, not so good. As for fusion, I cannot say much or anything at all; probably, like everybody else who considered to continue having an active (by that I mean sports) life, I ruled it out in hope that TAR = joint flexibility as opposet to fusion = permanent stiffness forever, or so I thought. I still maintain that my decision for TAR was right one for my case and so farI am happy with the result I've got."
"All the best."
"My late father had an ankle fusion and it was the best thing he did. He walked well and WITHOUT a limp. Don't believe all what the doctor says. Ask people who have experienced this. My late father was free from pain. 🙂"
"How did you get the surgery approved??? I'm 23 and every doctor I've talked to about the replacement told me no because of my age"
"My options are ankle fusion and ankle replacement"
"Leaning towards replacement"
"What was your recovery time"
"Its really refreshing to hear stories like yours, I've had the replacement a year now (Nov15) and I'm so glad I had it done - I've been told not to run, but would love to hear from people who can."
"Hi Amanda,"
"Sorry just hopped on this site and your story stuck out. I just turned 30, and have had 6 surgeries to repair my ankle after a fall. I have had a subtalur fusion and have extremely limited range of motion. My only option right now is a replacement, but I'm nervous cause of my age. How is yours going after a year?"
"Hi, I'm about to get a STAR TAR and I'm incredibly nervous about the procedure. I have no cartilage left in my ankle and every step is painful but I can still surf, ride a bike, get around... my fear is, what if the replacement is worse than what I have now. It sounds like you've had a very positive experience and I'd love to hear how you're doing at this point. I'm male, late 50's, very active, and in good shape. Thanks"
"I am having a TAR next Friday. Had fusion last April as I need both surgeries due to auto accident 6 years ago and 5 surgeries since the accIdent . Pain is constant, had to quit golfing, walking, any distance requires crutches or knee walker. Limited to stationary bike, and floor exercises such as bridge lifts(100 pr day) bicycle crunches, etc. Ten weeks non weight bearing caused atrophy in my leg so working have hard to get it back before next surgery. I read this blog and hope my situation works out well. I know it will be 10 weeks again, and months before I'm active again. I'm late 60's and was extremly active in all sports. Not a good candidate for couch potatoe lifestyle. my surgeon is using a Wright in bone, as I have small bones, and considered small woman."
"Good luck and keep us posted. The couch potato life isn't for me either... fingers crossed!"
"Hello Amanda, my name is Bob , I'm a 63 years old,and have severe arthritis in both ankles. I am researching Boston Hospitals and procedures. I have been considering the STAR procedure. I used to play tennis ,hike,run etc.I have been surfing my whole life and still get out surfing when I have the occasional ""good day"". I have had bone spurs removed with no results with less pain. I would be real pleased to be able to walk without bad pain and surf long board style. If you could share the hospital that treated you it would help me start my search for a seasoned physician for a TAR in Boston."
"I'm really glad and encouraged to hear you are doing well with your TAR."
"It takes about a year for the numbness to go away. In some cases it doesn't go away completely. After my replacement my toes an entire top of my foot was numb. 19 months later I have tiny bit of numbness on the top of my foot but it doesn't bother me at all. It's barely noticeable. Give it time"
"Research the failure rate with the Star. Do as much research as you can. I have the Wright Infinity replacement. While I know people who have Star replacements , many of them needed revisions early on and some of them failed completely. The difference between the Star and other replacement is that the Star is a mobile bearing device . That plastic piece in the middle can slip causing replacement failure and future surgeries. I encourage you to get a second and third opinion. After stating this I can also add that I've talked to people that are happy with their Star too. I just encourage you to check the recent failure rates."
"I got my replacement st 48. I'm very active . I have had a subtalar fusion as well as a heel alignment with my replacement. I'm very active. The subtalar fusion often prolongs the life of the replacement , which is a good thing if you are active. I don't have the same range of motion as my left foot but I'm still really happy . I have a normal walking gait, bicycle, hike in rough terrain, and work on my feet 40 hours a week. I have met other people your age that have had replacements.At your age I would stay away from total ankle fusion ."
"An ankle fusion can be great for someone who is not very active. However , I have met so many people who ended up get arthritis in the rest of the foot due to the fusion . This is very common with fusions . I'm very happy with my replacement. I am now pain free. I had an extremely complicated case so that fact that I am now pain free and very active I am so happy I didn't opt for the fusion. Get a second and third opinion if you are still not sure what you want to do....."
"This is caused by the tiny wear debris leading to cysts in some patients which can then lead to the failure of the prosthesis! This is what I’m facing after having had my ankle for only four years."
"Most ankle surgeons will not explain this very real danger before your surgery which I think is disgraceful. You only have to look at their web sites to confirm this."
"Cheers Richard"
"Cheers Richard"
"sounds exactly like my situation. Where are you and Advanced Ortho located? My orthopod (Dr. Patton, Arrowhead Ortho, Redlands CA) is anxiuos to do a Wright replacement, and he has given me Orthovisc injections which provide some relief. Scheduling & family assistance is big problem."
"Hi Mike,"
"My two cents."
"?I’m a 66 year old male in relatively good shape."
"On September 1, 1991 I broke both right leg bones and crushed my ankle and heel. I’ve been living with moderate pain and very limited mobility for the past 26 years. I chose not to have a fusion. I waited all those years searching for an ankle replacement that looked good to me."
"Earlier this year I discovered the Inbone Ankle replacement. One of the more difficult things for a surgeon to do during this type of surgery is to remove your ankle and properly align the replacement into the correct position. The Inbone system eliminates this. 6 weeks prior to surgery a CT scan is taken of your ankle. From this your new ankle is manufactured along with the Inbone Prophecy. The Prophecy instructs the surgeon what to remove and how to place the new ankle, thus greatly reducing the chance for human error."
"I had replacement surgery on Friday June 9, 2017 in Hendersonville TN. On Saturday a nurse helped me out of bed and had me stand with weight on both legs. I was able to do this with no problem. I stayed in the hospital one night and was discharged the next afternoon with a splint on my leg and 60 Oxycodone pain pills."
"I had mild pain for 4 days after the surgery and took a total 8 Oxycodones to help relieve the pain during that time. After 4 days I had very little pain. I did take 1 Oxycodone each night to help me sleep for 7 more days. After that I was pain free. I was allowed to shower with full weight on my ankle immediately providing my splint did not get wet. I was able to buy a splint cover for $35 at a local medical supply shop."
"On Wednesday June 28 the splint was removed and I was placed into a hard cast. My next appointment is Wednesday July 19. At that time the cast and all stitches are scheduled to be removed and I expect to be given a walking boot."
"I’m ecstatic with the results so far. I’ll post further updates as time goes by and I begin to walk."
"I had a TAR almost 4 years ago in Boston. At that time the Baptist was the best for this procedure. At 53 they said I was too young. At 55 I did my research regarding fusion and why I didn't want one. Basically as someone else on this thread indicated you can get arthritis elsewhere from unnatural movement. I have arthritis in many joints and didn't want this. My mobility and pain is much better than before but it's not great. I dropped the ball as I was out of state. I am finally following up. Seems the ankle is fine. Swelling and pain is tendinitis. I am going to start treatment for this and I hope to have a complete recovery. I will say this my TAR has the same mobility as the other ankle. Tendon pain keeps me off my feet."
"Dear Bruce"
"That's fantastic news. If your research did not flag up osteolysis this is something to be aware of as it can effect all man made joints due to the wear debris reacting with the body."
"Not too much is known about it and it is not something surgeons warn you about before surgery but it is very real. The TAR I had four years ago has gone wrong because of this and because of the degredation to the bone a revision is not likely to be an option nor the fall back of a fusion."
"Everyone owes it to themselves to be aware of the possibility and to make a point of asking their surgeons to look carefully at the X rays at each check up for any signs of this starting."
"I had made an excellent recovery as you can see if you Google Yogesh TAR total ankle replacement."
"Cheers"
"Richard"
"Thanks for the response, good to know the surgeon's that do well, and the ones that don't."
"Hello Richard,"
"Sorry to hear that you have osteolysis. Has there been any thing positive since your post 7 months ago?"
"I had a TAR in 2010 and although it took a few years for the ankle/foot to be happy again after the TAR - I have found it was a blessing, having reduced my pain by about 80%. Sure, I still have some pain and swelling, some cramps as well as some numbness some restrictions of movement - but I was very pleased with the outcome. i used to go up or down stairs sideways, like a crab lol lol before my TAR."
"Unfortunately last week at my 7 year post op review my orthopod told me that my x-ray and CT Scan revealed one rather large cyst on the tibia and one smaller one on the fibular - possibly caused by as you said ""tiny wear debris""."
"But on a more positive note he proceeded to tell me that he could drain the fluid out of my cysts and fill the cavities with some sort of synthetic bone transplant that should harden in there and after a few years will be like new again."
"Oh the reason we are not using my own bone from my own hip for the transplant is because the larger cyst is a fair size and he said that my hip would certainly protest after we were to take a large chunk out."
"I am scheduled to have this done on the 25th of October 2017 and if you like, I will post again after the op to let you know how I went."
"Regards Esther"
"Dear Esther"
"Thanks for asking. It has bee a very trying year really. I was all set ti have a revision of my ankle to deal with the failing TAR and the osteolysis but then my twenty year old hip on the other side decided that it was a really good time to wear the cup out and that meant a revision."
"I had to find a surgeon who I felt was good on revisions and then wait for the surgery which was in early May. On my return home in the passenger ambulance I was thrown onto the floor as the driver had not waited for me to put my sat belt on. As it was thought that I had suffered a cracked pelvis I was ordered to not weight bear until June 21so I was confined to my bed room as I was not to use the stairs. A very frustrating time, however I started weight bearing on June 21sst and have made excellent progress and am fully recovered."
"My pre. op for the ankle is at the end of September with the surgery set for October 22rd. My gut feeling is that this will be delayed but I hope not. I've been getting strange feelings of pain running up my leg for nearly a year and they are getting steadily worse. It is just a warning to me that time is running out for my ankle."
"It is good that your osteolysis was picked up at your annual check up. It amazes me that the dangers of osteolyssis are not made clear before surgery....it's as if it is a dirty secret. Not that it would stop us going ahead with surgery but it is not right that we are not informed so that we have all the facts. I suspect that many surgeons are ignorant of this risk as most ankle surgeons do so few ankle replacements that their experience of the surgery is limited."
"I hope our conversation helps to bring this to the attention of those about to have the surgery and especially those who have had it to ask their surgeons to check for any signs of it at all of their check-ups."
"Best wishes and please keep posting your progress."
"Cheers Richard"
"Wow Richard - you have ""been in the wars"", so to speak. I'm sorry to hear."
"I would like to know if your osteolysis is the same as my two bone cysts, as I live in Australia and my orthopod referred to my problem as a bone cysts filled with fluid which he will drain and then fill the cavity with a synthetic bone graft. Is this the same as your osteolysis?"
"My op is scheduled on the 23rd of Oct., only one day after yours, provided they go ahead with yours."
"I would really love to hear from anyone else who has had a synthetic bone graft or even an auto-graft from their own healthy bone."
"Take care and all the best. Esther"
"Yes it is one and the same. Had mine been spotted earlier this is what would be been the course of action. My surgeon felt that the artificial paste had the advantage that it could be pumped into every part of the cavity whereas actual bone could not be packed in as completely."
"I hope that is of some help."
"Cheers"
"Richard"
"Dear Ultrarunner"
"Glad to hear that all went well for you. I had my TAR five years ago but due to osteolysis I'm having to have it revised in a few weeks time. Unfortunately just when I was to have the revision my total hip replacement of twenty years ago on the other side failed and it was necessary to wait until I had recovered from that surgery."
"The delay has meant that the revision has far less chance of success. Over the five years I had the TAR I've gone heavy building and hill sheep farming and although have had twinges from it I've not had to restrict myself apart from not running though I could have. If you Google Yogesh total ankle replacement you wil see a short video of my walking and running up and down stairs at 20 weeks post op."
"Best wishes, Richard"
"I was operated on by Dr. Jockel. He moves to Colorado. There is a greaT dr. he worked under who heads this area of surgery. please use The New England Baptist directory to find his information."

"I would like to estabish contact with anyone who has undergone ankle replacement surgery and reflect a ittle on the aftereffects and the longer term prognoses for recovery and mobility."
"Having undergone such an operation about 9 months ago I am currently coming to terms with a less than welcome (and certainly unexpected) imapct upon my life and mobility."
"Issues such as lack of mobility, excessive swelling and cronic pain from the ankle itself but also from the toes and lack of sensation and feeling in parts of the foot are those I am facing and would like to know how other poeple have fared, both in the short and longer term."

"My wife had her ankle replacement three weeks ago."
"She's been essentially bed-ridden for the last three weeks and faces another week before physio starts."
"The wound is healing well, but she's battling with pain and discomfort as she wrestles with trying to get mobility back into her ankle in a plastic boot/removable cast."
"I'm not sure we'd have anything to help you in your situation (especially as your op was now about 18 months ago, but it might be good to get in contact."
"As a 7 month post op TAR I was wondering how your wife is progressing. I guess she is a couple of months ahead of me. I have good mobility most days but I'm not without pain. I am able to walk my dogs again for about 2 hours, three times a week and this is over fairly rough terrain. I get no significant swelling but the pain is sometimes debilitating. Am I expecting too much too soon?"

At the same time she felt I needed an insole to support the arches. I bought the boots and wear them at work Monday to"
"Friday It works! Within 2 weeks the swelling ad subsided. Most of the pain had gone and I feel much more mobile and at ease. I am still working with the hospital orthotics dept on an insole but I don't feel this"
"is germane to the ankle problem Believe me it changed the whole situation almost overnight. After 2years of regret I now feel the operation was worthwhile. Hope this may help looking forward or indeed coping with the current early days despair."
"I have a friend who had surgery on his ankle about 18 months ago, and he says if he'd known the extent of the pain and the disappointing outcome he'd never have considered it. He has to wear flat heavy-looking footwear, and as a female used to dainty heels (thing of the past) its bad enough wearing 'sensible' shoes without going down the orthotics route."
"His surgeon says the operation was a success - meaning he did what he intended to do with rods and pins, and the healing is complete - so there's nothing more to be done. This is unsatisfactory for the patient who is still in pain and has even more reduced mobility than before."
"I shall struggle on with whats left of my original bones."
"I do hope you can get sufficient physio to help you regain some mobility, I find swimming helps a little, but not much."

"My foot is very sore and stiff. My balance is off. I can do about 60 % of my normal physical work. A leisuraly walk is out of the question. All my energy and endurance must be saved for necessary activity. I am concerned and disapointed, I thought I would be further along. Doc says foot can be fixed with simple sugery. Not intereste, thanks anyway. I do not have the level of pain that I had pre surgery. My mobility is very comprised, toes and forefoot stiff and painfull."

"Hi Shanda. I'm jumping in univited. I crushed my ankle in 1991 and lived with moderate pain for 26 years while researching ankle replacements and waiting for the right one to come along. Earlier this year I decided to have my ankle replaced with the Infinity Inbone/Prophecy system. My surgery was June 9, 2017. I was given nerve blocks for pain which wore off after 24 hours. My surgeon prescribed 60 Oxycodne pills but informed me that only 2 of his many patients ever needed to use all of the pills. I began taking the pain medication on the morning following my surgery to ""stay on top of the pain"". I took 4 pills that day and night. The next morning I woke to discover that my pain wasn't any worse than prior to the surgey. I took 3 pills that day and each of the next 2 days. After that I took 1 pill prior to bedtime to help me sleep for about another 10 days. My ankle was basically pain free. I'm now about 10 weeks post surgery and the only pain I've had has been related to stretching and strengthening my muscles and tendons. I took 1 more pain pill after a day in which I broke up some scar tissue on the right side of my ankle. I'm in an aircast now and will be for another 2 weeks at which time I visit my surgeon with the expectation that I will be placed into my regular shoes. I'm currently able to walk with or without shoes with no pain, just stiffness which should go away over time, but I do stay in the aircast as most of the time per my surgeon's advice. I know each operation is unique as are each patient and each doctor. I just figured I'd let you know that for me the pain was a huge non-issue, especially after reading all of the horror stories. I hope you see the same results with the Infinity that I have.."
"I had a TAR five years ago and am waiting to have it revised due to osteolysis. It seems that there was some evidence of it at the time of surgery but it was not dealt with and it spread."
"This is just to warn everyone to be aware that osteolysis can effect all joint replacements but it seems that it is potentially a bigger hidden danger for ankles. Please confirm with your surgeon at each check up that there is no evidence of it."
"The surgery transformed my life but the future looks bleak but hopefully you will be fine."
"Cheers Richard"
"Thanks for the notice. My research prior to my surgery did not pick up any instance of this condition."
"I did some searching online last night and today and the only instances of this occurring that I was able to find were with the AES and HINTEGRA ankle replacements and these seemed to have taken place at least several years ago. I have not found any reports of this condition with the Inbone ankle but I will ask my surgeon about this when I see him in three weeks."
"Regards,"
"Bruce"
"Dear Bruce"
"There is a lot of stuff about it out there especially in various research papers. surgeons are very reluctant to say anything about it...its as if it's a dirty secret."
"Please be fully aware of it's danger and make sure others are aware of it and directly ask at every check up to avoid being in the same situation as I'm now in."
"You can see how well I was doing at twenty weeks by googling Yogesh total ankle replacement. Let me know if that fails to bring it up please."
"Cheers Richard"
"Hi Tara. I'm also in CA and looking for a doctor for a TAR. It sounds like yours is successful. I saw one doc that wants to do the Infinity, and it sounds good, but it's hard to know where to research doctors. I feel like I need more information and a second opinion before taking the leap. It would be great to know where you are located or who your doctor is. I'm on the central coast of CA but would travel."
"Here in the UK there were about 800 TAR surgeries done last year by a large number of surgeons and I understand most surgeons only do less than five a year so are getting very little experience. This I gather leads to poorer results than should be the case and I bear witness to this and face a very uncertain outcome to try to find a solution to my failing prosthesis."
"This is a very technical, tricky and exacting surgery and I urge anyone going in for a TAR to be fully ware of this situation. It may be different in the US but I somehow doubt it!"
"Good luck. Richard"
"Hi, I had a STAR replacement on April 6th of this year by Dr. Thordarson at Cedars Sinai. No real pain, easy recovery. Non weight bearing for a month, followed by a month in a walking boot, and then... Walking, hiking, surfing, riding a bike... pretty much pain free. Amazing! Before the surgery I hadn't taken a pain free step in 7 years... it's not 100% but it's 90+% at this point, and I'll take that any day of the week. Good luck."
"I think he's probably the best ankle surgeon in the western U.S. What I did before surgery was ask a lot of Physical Therapist and other Docs who they'd recommend for a TAR and Thordarson seemed to be the one they all liked. Once again, good luck!"
"Hope this will help."
"I had TAR last week with Shannon Rush MD PAMF, El Camino Hospital in Mountain View. At 9 days out, things seem good: no blood, little pain, minimal antibiotics."
"I found Dr. Rush this way:"
"Went to a non surgical DO and got his opinion. I have had good experience with this DO in the past. He said Dr Rush was by far his first choice."
"I spent a lot of time on line and confirmed that Dr. Rush might be the best."
"My primary doc talked with Rush and said he seemed like the right guy."
"I talked with a guy in my golf club who had had TAR and he said Dr. Rush was great, and performed a successful surgery with him a year ago."
"I talked with my physical therapist and she said that she had worked with Dr. Rush's patients, and they were all positive about him."
"He is a pretty straightforward guy. Not chatty, but pleasant."
"I was in El Camino hospital for a night. Rush said that this is often done as an outpatient procedure."
"I have never used this forum before so I don't know if I will get notified if you ask another question. I may check back in a week or so."
"Mike"
"I'm now 3 months removed from surgery. As of last week I'm out of the boot and in sneakers and hiking boots. I've had no pain other than that associated with using muscles and tendons that haven't been used in 26 years. I'm now able to walk or slowly jog on a treadmill, hike, do squats and lunges with weights, etc. I should have full range of motion within the next 9 months. I'm ecstatic with the results so far."
"The surgery took place in Hendersonville TN USA. The device was the Infinity Inbone/Prophecy system. I had researched this for many years before deciding on the Inbone, Other patients reported very good results. The doc is Marc Tressler. He's performed more than 700 total ankle replacements over the years, I believe there are only 3 docs in the US who have performed more. There is more detail in my reply to shanda1980 from 25 days ago. Let me know if you have any questions."
"Dear Bruce"
"So glad that all went well for you. I'm interested to know if you were told about osteolysis before you had this surgery."
"I had a TAR in the UK five years and am having to have a revision next month due to osteolysis destroying the bones were the prosthesis is."
"The galling thing is that I had full mobility following the surgery and only minor discomfort in the following years and it was a year ago at my annual check up that it was found that I had a huge problem and it has taken all this time to get to a revision due to the complexity if the situation."
"There is a Youtube video showing me walking, and running up and down stairs at twenty weeks. If anyone is interested Google Yogesh total ankle replacement Kenward to get to it."
"My new surgeon who is very experienced would like to use the Infinity but since my bone quality has been badly compromised he is doubtful about how successful the revision will be."
"Osteolysis is something that can effect all artificial joints but it seems that TAR are much more likely to be effected."
"Cheers. Richard"
"Thank you so much for joining in and responding! I am so glad to hear of someone with a good outcome! I believe I had no other choice but to have an ankle replacement. I did not go with the inbone, although I did choose the infinity TAR. The surgeon was very pleased with the outcome and believes I will make a full recovery."
"My surgery was on the 23rd of August and I spent 3 days in the hospital for pain management and I developed a low grade fever."
"They wanted me to take 2--5mg OxyContin pills every 6 hours. There were times when I did need them but most of the time I only took 1 pill every 6 hours. Since addiction runs in my family, I was scared to keep taking them so I called and expressed this to my dr so he changed my pain meds to 1 Percocet 5 every 6 hours and I am doing fine with that, if I even need to take meds at all."
"My follow up is sept 14th and I will be getting out of the cast and getting stitches out. Hopefully I will be starting PT 3-4 days a week."
"At this point, I am very pleased. Barely any pain at all so far! I am very glad for your recovery as well! Many thoughts and prayers headed your way!"
"Bruce,"
"This is great news!!!! I am so happy for you, most people who never have had their ability to walk normally or live in pain, won't understand what a relief it is when you are finally able to be pain free!!!"
"I am 17 days out of surgery and the pain relief I feel is outstanding. I do have good and bad days, but the good days outweigh the bad by 90%! Although I have a long way before I can consider myself 100% again, I am very optimistic for my recovery so far! I go back on September 14th for my first follow up, they will take me out of the cast, remove my sutures, and hopefully place me in a boot, then set me up for Physical Therapy."
"I only need to take 1 Percocet 5mg when I wake up. The rest of the day, I am fine!"
"I am able to do housework, while sitting on my walker (which has a set and wheels). When I go outside to visit with my horses and pig, I'm in my wheelchair and I have no pain other than the occasional nerve pain in my toes, which I was told that is normal and will subside eventually, seeing the nerves, tendons, and muscles are healing."
"I wish there was a way to post pictures on this site. I would love to share with you what my ankle looked like after my initial injury back in 2013."
"If you would like to see it, you can email me and I can send it to you through email."
"I look forward to keeping up with your progression!!! Hearing your updates....make me feel very hopeful about my future progress!!!"
"Thank you & congrats on your progress thus far!!!!"

"Hi Shanda, I'm 38 and planning to have a TAR in the next few months, due to a 24 year old severe fracture that has resulted in end stage artheritis. The news that I had reached this stage was a shock, I'm obviously in a lot of pain and mobility has reduced steadily but still a shock to find how limited my options would be, especially still being relatively young and a single working mum, my life has changed dramatically and I know I have a lot to come. Reading your comments has filled me out th hope after being tearful for the last few weeks. So happy you seem to be recovering well!"

"Claire x"
"Hi Claire! I am truly sorry that it's come to the point where you have to have a TAR. Do you know which prosthetic they will be using?"
"Believe me, having a TAR, isn't necessarily a bad thing. I can tell you that deciding to have a TAR was the best decision of my life. My surgery was on August 23, 2017 and I honestly tell you that I am about 95-96% pain free! The first few days after the surgery was pretty rough, I won't lie to you. But as of today, this is the first time since my accident that I can say I'm almost pain free."
"I am starting physical therapy soon. Hopefully in 2 weeks, I will be able to start walking."
"If I may give you a little advice for a successful recovery..."
"1. Do exactly what your Dr says."
"2. DO NOT put any weight on it at all for at least 6 -8 weeks."
"3. When they take the cast off and put you into a boot....when you take the boot off, start rotating it slowly, don't force any movement."
"4. When your discharged from the hospital, continue elevating it. (I still keep mine elevated)"
"5. No matter what, do physical therapy for as long as you can. (It will hurt like hell, but the pain is only temporary but the outcome will be worth it!"
"Before my TAR, I was in constant severe pain to the point where it was debilitating. For me to be almost pain free.....I can't tell you how good it feels knowing I will have a better quality of life now! My dr even said that once I am completely 100% healed, I may even be able to jog (I was a runner), I will be able to ride and train horses again. I even know of a man who is able to snowboard after he healed from his TAR."
"I hope you have a successful surgery and recovery! This forum has helped me so much mentally and emotionally, going through this process. These people are amazing!!! If you have any questions or advice, we are here for you! If you want to keep in contact, you can send me your email through the private message feature on here!"
"Good luck!!"
"Shanda"
"Shanda, thank you so much for the advice and the kind words, I will take every bit of advice, I feel a million times better just hearing other people going through the same as me, I've been feeling so alone, it as if all the memories of my original accident at age 14 came back, struggling with constant pain and struggling to fit in and play down my disability. Yours and the others on this thread have given me courage and hope. I'm not sure what implant they will be using I see the surgeon on the 9th October so will post regular updates, all also PM you my email."
"Thank you ????"
"This forum and people really helped me as well. That's one thing your not, is alone! Not in here!"
"My surgeon used the infinity prosthetic on me. I did a lot of research on different ones. It may help you to do some research on different TAR prosthetics. Google TAR prosthetic. One that is popular and has a good success rate is the inbone. You can look up star, infinity, inbone, invision, and prophecy. Hope that helps a little bit to get you started!"
"It always pays to do your research before you see your surgeon."
"Here in the UK a large number of surgeons do very few each year which is very bad for many patients because they are likely to have a much worse outcome than they expect. Happened to me."
"Cheers, Richard"
"Thanks so much for your information. I called the office of Dr. Rush and was told that they don't keep track of how many TARS they have done or the success rate. That seemed a little odd to me. I thought that was a standard question from someone considering that type of surgery. I'm still looking for a doctor in the Bay Area in California or someplace within driving distance. I'm in the Santa Cruz area and saw Dr. Abidi but I'm not feeling very optimistic about proceeding with that office."
"HI Mike,"
"I'm strongly considering a STAR ankle replacement with Dr Rush, as well. I'm just checking in with you to see how it is progressing now that you're a few months out of surgery. Any information on your progress and if you feel it was the right decision would be very helpful. Thanks."
"--dan"
"Sounds very odd and not very professional. I would avoid any surgeon who did not keep a record of his/her surgeries. Here in the a UK I think it is a requirement of all surgeons which makes it an easier job when choosing a surgeon."
"Cheers Richard"
"Choosing to run after a TAR or similar surgery seems to me to be a very bad idea unless the aim is to have it fail early! Same goes for hips."
"Cheers Richard"
"Regards,"
"Bruce"
"Cheers Richard"
"Maybe I exaggerated a little bit. My ""jog"" was very, very slow. Just slightly faster than a fast walk. I did that for a few sessions at the gym but it wasn't comfortable. So now I just use an elliptical machine where I don't need to concern myself with my balance or my stride."
"Regards,"
"Bruce"
"I am in the same similar situation but Drs. I've seen aren't helpful. What Dr. Did your TAR?"
"Please check out their experience with that prosthesis and their level of successful outcomes."
"My TAR five years ago by a surgeon with limited experience needs to be revised now and because he set it badly off centre it will be a messy job . Probably due to this the bone has developed osteolysis which increases the difficulties."
"Ankle replacement surgery is a very exacting difficult surgery and it needs to be got right first time or the implications are likely to be devastating ."
"Good luck, Richard"
"Jan,"
"I would like to echo what Richard wrote. Ankle replacement is much different than knee or hip. Compared to hip or knee, the foot is more complex structure consisting of many joints, TAR is a much more recently developed procedure, TAR is a much more complex procedure to perform, and surgeons in general have much less experience performing them. I had my right done 11/1/16 and my left done 12/1/17. It took me 2 years to make the final decision to have the first one done, and consulted several ankle surgeons in several major referral centers in the NE until I made my decision. I waited each time until I simply could not walk due to the pain, and I lead a very active lifestyle as a golfer and sailor. I am very satisfied with the results, and hope to get back this spring to walking the golf course and sailing my boat on Lake Ontario."
"The local surgeon here in Syracuse planned to use the Inbone prosthesis, which other surgeons seem to feel is better reserved for re-do's. The local surgeon in my opinion had not done enough of them to make me comfortable. A surgeon in Mass General in Boston I saw was clearly very experienced and capable, but I did not want to travel 6 hours for each appointment. I found a highly regarded surgeon in Rochester, 1.5 hours away who was well published and past president of the American Society of Foot and Ankle surgeons and she referred me to a colleague who was in his 40's and doing quite a few TAR's over several years. Driving 1.5 hours each way for post op apts is not easy, but is doable, especially considering we can have lake effect blizzards daily, and has not been a major problem, but I would not want to have to go back and forth to Buffalo, Boston, or NYC for the post op visits."
"In addition to the ankle pain, before my right TAR in 2016, I was also experiencing a lot of heel pain. The local surgeon felt my heel pain represented plantar fasciitis, but I was not convinced. He kept giving me steroid injections into the ankle and wanted to inject the plantar fascia as well, which I did not agree to. The surgeon who eventually did my TAR, more carefully examined me and suggested that my heel pain was actually secondary to subtalar joint arthritis, not plantar fasciitis, and suggested a right subtalar joint fusion in addition to TAR. It turned out he was right on target. The subtalar fusion takes a long time to heal (a full year) compared to the TAR, but I would have continued with crippling pain from the subtalar arthritis had I not had the subtalar fusion."
"I would also like to state that it is my opinion that the steroid injections destroyed my ankle joint over the year that I had 3-4 of them. It is my understanding that steroid injections can hasten the process of degenerative arthritis, and my current surgeon states that it is the general consensus nationally that no ankle injects should be given to anyone."
"Each surgeon has his/her own preference for prosthesis, and I think the key is how much experience each has doing the procedure. I suggest asking straightforwardly, ""how many have your done, and how many with this prosthesis, how many complications have you seen and what kind of complications?"" Get a recommendation from a local general orthopedist if you have such a relationship. Ask your PCP help in finding someone. Get as many opinions from various foot and ankle surgeons or podiatrists that you can until you are comfortable with your decision. Bring a friend, spouse or significant other with you to each apt for a second set of eyes and ears."
"If one correctly by an experienced ankle surgeon or podiatrist, one has a good chance of success with TAR. Having it done by an inexperienced surgeon may potentially increase your risk of complications."
"Dear James"
"You are 100% correct. Here in the UK where I live many surgeons are doing very few ankle replacements which leads to many poor outcomes. It is almost as if they feel that it is important to be able to list it on their CV. This is IMO very unfair and costs our National Health Service a huge amount in revision surgery."
"I would like to make people aware of a big danger surgeons usually fail to talk about when setting out the risks attached to this surgery!"
"It is Osteolysis. This is bone degeneration caused by cysts in the bone and is thought to be caused by the interaction of the wear debris generated by the new joint causing a reaction that ones body cannot cope with."
"The body can usually deal with a small amount of this debris but if the joint is badly set the amount of wear debris is potentially going to be very much higher as in my case and being very active too simply increases the risk!"
"I've been trying to get my TAR revised for over a year and am now happy with the surgeon I've selected and his proposed plan of action. This just should not have happened."
"Members may be be interested in seeing a short video of me walking up and down a slope and trotting up and down a flight of stairs at twenty weeks post op. You will understand why I feel so gutted at the subsequent failure of my prosthesis! For anyone interested just Google yogesh total ankle replacement kenward."
"Please do not be put off having this amazing surgery but do go into it with both eyes open and find a really experienced surgeon. Dies not matter a jot if you like or dislike them as you are the one who will ha e to live with the consequences of the surgery for the rest of your life."
"Cheers Richard"
"Dr. Sam Flemister did the surgery. I first saw in Rochester Dr Judy Baumhauer, who is past president of the American Society for Foot and Ankle surgery, and very highly thought of nationally, and she said she was mostly doing research now and not doing as many TAR's, and suggested I see Dr Flemister. I have been very happy with Dr. Flemister. I also consulted Dr DiGiovanni at Mass General, who has done a ton of TAR's, who recommended Dr Flemister as well, since I did not want to wait 8-10 months to get on Dr DiGiovanni's schedule and also did not want to have to drive 5-6 hours to appointments. I saw a local Syracuse surgeon a few times and decided for several reasons to not have him do the surgery. I didn't think he had done enough of them, he was going to use the Inbone prosthesis, which seems huge to me, and he did not correctly diagnose the heel pain I was having (he thought it was secondary plantar fasciitis, when it turned out to be secondary to subtalar joint arthritis). The local doctor also gave me a series of steroid injections which I feel hastened the destruction of the joint."
"Many thanks for your prompt response. I met with Sam Flemister this week and he concurs with another orthopaedic surgeon - TAR is my only option. May I ask, and please be direct, what is the pain level after surgery. I'll hop, roll, jump do whatever is needed to recover but would like to 'program' myself for post surgical pain. Flemister seems to be the surgeon who has the most experience in this area."
"I had an TAR with an Infinity device on June 9 of 2017. Everyone's pain tolerance is unique, each surgeon is unique, and each ankle is unique. Having said that I can tell you that I had virtually no pain after surgery. They did a spinal block on Friday the day of surgery which was to last 24 hours. I had some discomfort at 9 AM the next day so I took an Oxycodon-Acetaminoohen 7.5 - 325 to ""stay on top of the pain"". I took 3 pills that day and 1 at 2:00 AM the next morning. When I woke up later that morning I realized I had only mild pain which was no worse than what I had lived with for 26 years while trying to decide what TAR and surgeon to choose. I took 2 pills during the day and 1 just prior to going to bed. After that I took 1 pill each night for about a week just to help me sleep. I'm now 7 months out and I couldn't be happier. Maybe my story is unusual but I firmly believe the surgeon and TAR model you choose make a huge difference. I've been all over the east coast over the years getting opinions from John Hopkins in Baltimore, the Hospital for Special Surgery in NY, etc. The surgeon I used just outside of Nashville has performed over 800 of these operations."
"Best of luck and keep us posted."
"800 surgeries is remarkable! I investigated going out of area to have the surgery, but so many expenses would not be covered by my insurance if I did so. I have a pretty high tolerance with pain, and like you said, compared to the grinding we've lived with, a few uncomfortable days is well worth it. Thank you for responding. I'm leaning towards going with the most experience surgeon in Rochester NY."
"thanks, Mike"
"Yes. Dr. Marc Tressler. It's been awesome, a life changing experience. No more pain and after 7 months I don't even think about my ankle."
"Yes, there are only a few surgeons in the US who have performed more of these surgeries. I would definitely recommend checking the experience level of your surgeon. I chose the Infinity because with that TAR the placement of the new ankle is for the most part taken out of the surgeons hands with a device they call the Prophecy. I've read so many horror stories in this blog regarding improper placement of the TARs. Good luck to you!"
"Dear Bruce"
"I very much support the premise that it is far too critical a surgery to be done by anyone than by a really experienced surgeon with lots of successful ankle replacement surgeries under their belts. As a result of a poor ankle replacement surgery some years ago I am waiting for what is likely to be a difficult revision so I'm speaking from bitter experience."
"Cheers, Richard"
"Dr Flemister is moderately experienced. There are doctors who have done more, but I think he has done enough to do a reliably good job. There is a doctor in Buffalo who has done several hundred, but I never consulted him. Dr Flemister is very down to earth and caring. He communicated directly with me via their portal messaging system when I needed. His office staff were very responsive to my needs as well. When I had a difference of opinion or questions about a direction we were going, he was very willing to discuss the issues openly, and review medical literature I sent him. I have no qualms about his care."
"Regarding post op pain: I had two divergent experiences. At my 2016 surgery, I had both a right TAR and a right subtalar fusion. I was given a nerve block and was told I would awaken from anesthesia without pain, and that the block would last about 24 hours. Unfortunately, I woke up in agony because the nerve block did not take. The pain was major for over 2 weeks, and it continued until almost a year after the surgery. However, I was able to enjoy sailing Lake Ontario and golf over the spring and summer (had to take a cart, could not hoof it), and took tylenol for the pain. I believe my abnormal gait from my other (left) ankle made my recovery from the right more prolonged."
"When I had the left TAR done in 12/17, my experience was the opposite. The nerve block was fabulous and lasted 36 hours. It was still in effect when I left the hospital. I didn't take my first pain med until I was home, and then only needed it for less than 2 weeks. The first week was the worst. I did not need the subtalar fusion for the left, and I think that played a role in having an easier time a year later with the left TAR. I do not regret having the right subtalar fusion, because the right subtalar joint was severely arthritic and was a major component of my right ankle pain prior to surgery."
"I had some minor delayed wound healing with both procedures, but it eventually worked out."
"The most difficult part of the recovery for me was not the pain, but the 6 weeks of non weight bearing. TAR's are different from total knee and hip because they do not use cement. The bone has to grow into the prosthesis, which takes 6+ weeks. Because they cement the knees and hips, one can walk immediately post-op knee and hip as soon as the anesthesia wears off, but not so with ankles."
"My words of advice are to take the nerve block (usually they work), keep your leg strictly elevated post op for the 6 weeks (reduces swelling and therefore reduces pain and promotes wound healing), do as much upper body exercise as you can to keep yourself sane (dumbbells, weight machine, stretch bands, etc), take the pain meds liberally as needed the first couple of weeks then switch to tylenol (barring any personal contraindications), ice pack the ankle for at least the first week or so15 minutes every 4 hours, (I suggest a Chattenooga cold pack"

"and be patient, and be patient, and be more patient. You will get frustrated, but be kind to your care givers. The 6 weeks seems like forever when you are going through it, but it passes. I found a knee walker to be great. I actually used it to go to basketball games at the Carrier Dome."
"Both times I was walking at 6 weeks with minimal discomfort. Dr Flemister preferred I continue using the post op boot for a month after starting weight bearing, but I could not because walking with the boot aggravated other joint problems (knees and hips)."
"Overall, I have no regrets for having had these procedures, and I am very grateful for the excellent medical care I received from Dr Flemister and his team. I would be in a wheelchair had it not been for his magical hands."
"Hi Richard,"
"I've read what you've gone through in the past and I can only imagine the difficulties you've encountered. Good luck with the revision and please keep us posted."
"Regards,"
"Bruce"
"Many thanks. Hope your ankle is doing well."
"All the best, Richard"
"I had the Wright In Bone TAR a little over 11 months ago. I can honestly say I have no pain, but I still have a lot of numbness. My two big toes and the bottom of my foot are numb. I am 66 years old and live in Eugene, Oregon. Nicholas Strasser was my surgeon and I believe he did a fine job, If the bottom of my foot gets bumped I will experience discomfort. It's like the nerve is there but just out of whack. The surgeon had to move the nerve in order to clean out the arthritis and he has told me that it could take a year or more for feeling to come back. Does anyone else have experience with numbness? I really don't have much of the prickly pin cushion sensations but I will feel little jolts of sensation every once in a while. I'd be interested in knowing if others have experiences this and if their feeling came back. Thanks!"
"John"
"Hi John. I never had numbness but I did have what felt like little jolts of electricity on the left side of my ankle. I had a large amount of scar tissue in that spot from my original accident. I believe the tingling was a result of the scar tissue breaking up as I regained movement in that area. It happened occasionally for about 4 months. I'm now 7 months in and have not had any recent occurrences."
"Possibly your jolts of sensation is just part of the healing process. Good luck."
"Bruce"
"I did not experience this with either of my TAR's"
"Wish I would have found this blog a few years ago, but that is moot at this point. I am about 7 weeks PO of what I so far feel is excellent procedure, but I've been looking to see if anyone else has had the following."
"Operation (TAR) went well with everyone involved pleased. Nerve block seemed to have lasted far longer than I expected. Stopped Percocet a day or two before prescription ran out as there really and still isn't any pain. Uncomfortable but no pain till day stitches removed. I've had stitches many times in my 67 years, but the last three (closest to top of foot) brought me to tears and looking for that stick to clench in my teeth like some old western movie. Since then I have had random shocks, burning sensations, and aches that are just enough to wake me up just as I fall asleep. I was hoping to find more references to this, but you seem to come the closest. No mess seem to effect this what so ever (Percocet, Flavil, over the counter anything, etc.). I think surgeon, post op nurse, and everyone else believes this is temporary and I'm hoping. Just wondering if you've heard or experienced anything similar."
"Thanks for any consideration. I still think the operation is todate a success and I'm pleased with surgeon et all, just wondering why my symptoms aren't mentioned."
"Kenneth, I am 11 weeks out. I have at time experienced a burning pain at the top of my incision. It lasts a few minutes and goes away. I attributed it to reaction to the suture material (don't know if this is correct or not). The burning is not as severe as what you describe, and has lessened in intensity as time goes on. Hope this is helpful"
"John I had mine done almost 4 months ago and my foot, toes, top of foot and lower leg still feel asleep! I did not have a nerve block. I am being told this is normal and may take up to a year. My swelling is pretty bad as well and that is the hardest part adding to my toes being numb, it is like going to the dentist and getting Novocain and feeling like your tongue and lips are swollen but really aren't, where in this case they are! My heal has been awake since almost the beginning and about a month ago I started feeling like I was stepping on tacks just in the middle of my foot that has not stopped or changed in anyway! I do have pain and discomfort everywhere in the area of the surgery. I have gotten more stiff lately and my range of motion and gone backwards too. So you are not alone!"
"Good Luck to you! My best suggestion would be to make sure you are mentally prepared for this! It may turn out to be more than a few uncomfortable days for you! I did not have the nerve block and the pain really wasn't too bad once I was home. As long as I didn't let my leg hang down! Always keep it propped way above your heart when sitting or laying! Listen to your surgeon when it comes to your incision! If not prescribed get some 15-20 compression socks when you can start wearing them to help with the swelling. Ice as much as you can! That being said, I'm 4 months out and I am regretting doing this each and every day now! I still cannot feel my foot/toes/lower leg, my swelling is horrible and my PT just cut me off after only 2 months because I'm not getting any better. My range of motion is not where it needs to be either. Yesterday I went to get a second opinion and the Dr. said ""I can see you were not prepared for this nor given all the information upfront"" and I guess I wasn't. Everybody is different but the dangers are the same for us all! Oh and don't let me forget this, my insurance company didn't pay my surgeon, they said it was not medically necessary because I did not meet the criteria. So that is another thing to make sure of. Just because it may be a covered benefit does not mean that they will pay for it!"
"Shelly, it has been 13 months since my surgery. I came out of the surgery with numbness in my two big toes the top of the foot and the bottom of my foot. I had tingly sensations for the first month or two. I really have not had pain since the first 10 days or so. I just have a foot that feels like a half a block of cement. Still have some swelling but I'm able to play golf 3 days a week and have no pain. The biggest thing is that I'm aware all the time that the ankle and foot do not feel normal. I just had a complete nuerological workup and the neurologist told me not to expect getting feeling back at this point. He said it was possible but not likely. So this is my new normal. I don't have the pain I used to have which is great but I'm always flexing my foot to see if the numbness is still there. I do have feeling but it's out of whack. If I were to bump the bottom of my foot it would hurt or if I have flushed my toe up against a baseboard I wouldn't know it till after a lengthy period of time and then I would feel it. All in All, I would do the operation again. I walk much better than I used to. Hang in there and hopefully you will progress in all areas."
"A short update. The surgery was carried out six weeks ago and appears to have gone well. The surgery took six hours and for protection I was on an antibiotic drip for ten days."
"Very little pain but totally shattered looking after myself at home. Now at six week feeling much stronger and capable."
"Been allowed partial and increasing partial weight bearing in the last few days but think that I may have set my recovery back because I'm now getting a little bit of pain and twinges."
"Another follow up visit to hospital next week so hopefully nothing horrible will be found!"
"Cheers Richard"
"​I am headed for the Infinity replacement and worried. I have a bunion on the same foot and bad feet to start with broke my ankle 2 years ago and arthritis now there and getting worse. How bad were the first few weeks and months after he TAR ? I see so much bad news from so many that I fear I may be worse of if I do this Infinity TAR and searching for anyone for advice to see if it is even worth doing ?"
"Hi Richard,"
"I have been reading your comments and the last one was 6 months ago. I do hope that by now your ankle is much better and you have not had to go through any revision surgery. I have just had an ankle arthroscopy at the RJAH Hospital near Oswestry with Mr. Andrew Bing. They were going to also do a foot correction due to no arches left, but abandoned this as they found I have no cartilage left, and therefore have final stage post traumatic arthritis. Mr. Bing has already done around 80 replacements and I found him via a previous patients whose replacement was very successful. My two options now are a fusion or a replacement. Can't have a fusion as my other ankle is not good either and I had CRPS very badly following a break. So, my only choice is a replacement. After the arthroscopy op, Mr. Bing said that I might not feel too much pain walking and this could last for 3 days, 3 weeks or even 3 years. Not sure at this stage how I will fare, as I am only in my 2nd weeks of recovery. I would really like to have the op soon and get on his waiting list, but having read all the comments above, I am not so sure."
"I am doing a lot of research and will ask him all the questions you suggested. Could you please let me know where and who did your replacement and have you heard of this hospital? I can only say good things about the care and this surgeon."
"Thank you very much for your response."
"Update for anyone who may be interested."
"OK, the revision surgery was on February 26th and I've made a fantastic recovery in the opinion of the surgeon. I have tried to be sensible and I started back to swimming as soon as my incision had fully healed about three months ago and go five days a week and swim for about ninety minutes."
"I was asked not to use my legs so as to avoid the danger of pumping fluid into where the surgeon had to repair a large cyst resulting from the original TAR which caused the trouble."
"I've started using my legs now for swimming but not all of the time as I was told to increase the use. Of course I overdid it and had to rest my ankle for several days but t did not prevent me from moving about."
"I've been back to full exercising for a couple of weeks and have walked up to four miles in one day with no ill effects, just slight tiredness in the ankle. Sometimes it feels a bit tender alost the feeling one gets from a bruise but it does not feel sensitive when squeezed."
"My gait is excellent and nobody would be able to tell that I have had a TAR. My stride length, and speed of walking is very good and I can keep up with guys half my age so I'm pretty happy."
"If anyone would like to talk on the phone about it then please message me. I am not prepared to try to do it by email as firstly I'm not fast on the keyboard and secondly you will get much more benefit from having a discussion. Just send me a message."
"Cheers Richard"
"I've just sent you my phone number. Cheers Richard"
"Dear all"
"Please call. If I don't pick up can you please leave me a voice mail and I will call you back"
"I need to talk to anyone who has either done a TAR or will be"
"Thanks.....David"
"Moderator comment: I have removed the phone number as we do not publish these in the forums. If users wish to exchange contact details please use the Private Message service."
"please can you tell me which surgeon you are now seeing many thanks"
"Hi Ellie,"
"to date, I have had an ankle arthroscopy 6 weeks ago at the RJAH Orthopaedic Hospital in Oswestry under Mr. Andrew Bing. Once they had done the debridement, it was found that I had no cartilage at all left, so will need a TAR. I researched very carefully for a surgeon who had already done a number of TAR's and Mr. Bing , I believe, has done some 70 TAR operations to date. I think he is brilliant and I would not go anywhere else, even though I live 2 1/2 hours away from this specialist hospital. I can't really comment on any other hospitals or surgeons, but you can research on the following website for specialists in ankle replacements."
"Good luck with your research and ask your doctor to refer you to the surgeon of your choice on the NHS."
"Let me know how you get on. Inge"
"thank you so much i live in central london , mr BINGS SECRETARY RECOMMENDED mr andrew goldberg in london . that just confirmed what i had been told . has anybody ever had surgery under mr andrew goldberg ??"
"Dear David"
"I also need a TAR and just deciding which surgeon to use < very tricky ?"
"Mr Bing recommended Mr Andrew Goldberg in london ."
"I see this post is 5 years old. How are you doing, these days. I am end stage on my ankle, but I can walk in 1 1/2"" wedge shoes most days."
"I only get about 30 minutes to an hour on my feet with rests inbetween."
"Was your doctor very experienced with TAR? I have seen 4 surgeon DPMs, young and not too experienced. One is 45 and more experienced, but I just don't believe the amount he says he has performed. 'Trust, but verify'."
"I am 69 and pretty fit, considering I shattered my ankle 47 years ago."
"I hope you see this and respond with good news."
"If I wait much longer, it may result in amputation as there are MANY subchondral defects (sacs filled with fluid)..."
"Thank you, in advance."
"Warm Regards,"
"Viki"
"Hi Viki"
"Thank you for the message."
"How am I doing these days... well it's been 5 years that I have had the TAR and if I compare to what I had before the TAR, I must say it was a worthwhile 5 years because I have had much less pain and more mobility than what I had before the TAR. Was my doctor experienced?. One must look at that in terms of how experienced the doctor was with the specific prosthesis and the procedure attached to that specific prostheses. In that regard, I heard after the operation that I was number two in Africa to receive that specific prosthesis so I guess he was not experienced enough but he still did a pretty good job. I was unlucky with the after-care and the healing process took longer than I anticipated so it could have been a much better outcome, was I aware of it."
"That said, at the moment I am struggling with a stress fracture of my Fibula close to the TAR and I have to wear a Moon boot for 6 weeks. The prothesis moved and the alignment is putting stress on my Fibula, to such an extend that it caused a stress fracture now. Apart from that also, I was told that the prosthesis is pretty loose and will eventually work it's way up the bone and that can cause huge damage to the bone...possibly split it etc. I can still walk on it with relatively low pain and movement of my foot and when I lie down, it is totally painless....very normal movement etc."
"In my case I really have two busted ankles and also very worn out shoulders...at 57 ...not a joke. So I have to be very careful what my next move have to be becasue I can not walk too far on crouches either. I currently have appointments with two surgeons. The one who did my TAR 5 years ago and the other is to my knowledge the most experienced and specialized ankle surgeon in my country. I have been to both in the past also. I need to find out what has perhaps happened in the last 5 years in terms of TAR revision etc. so that I can plot a way forward for my replaced ankle. Maybe there is also for me a bit of good news?. The other one will have to be fused, but not a complete fusion, only one of the three joints. Depending on what I come back with after my visit, I will have to make calls and plot my course of action going forward. I am very sick and tired of not being able to do things I want to do as a normal person and also of cutting back on my quality of life all the time. One has to get yourself up-and-running - figuratively speaking, as soon as possible."
"I am not against TAR at all. If a revision can be done with maybe a prosthesis that has a more sturdy method of fixation etc. I will have to consider it because I already have a hollowed out hole with a loose prosthesis in it currently. Taking it out and filling that gap is another longtime uncomfortable process, unless it can be filled with another prosthesis and that is why I have to consider revision surgery for that ankle."
"I have just spoken to a friend of mine who had both his ankles fused after they were crushed in a parachuting accident in 1986. Now, 30+ years later only things he complains about is the occasional cold winter pains and a bit of arthritis. If I knew him 5 years ago, I might have gone the fusion route instead because I was under the impression that walking with two ""stiff"" ankles will be very hard, which is in fact not the case."
"I have learned that each ankle case is unique because there are other factors e.g cysts and like in your case other sub-cordial defects etc.. Each one has to be judged on it's own merits and age does also play a role, as does levels of activity. I am actually much in the same boat as you in that regard, but I have two of them little buggers to worry about😒. If I were you, I would seriously consider ankle arthrodesis and not TAR. Chances of complications with TAR is just too high and once you have a TAR, ankle arthrodesis afterwards becomes much riskier and hard to perform due to loss of bone tissue. Don't let them tell you that ankle arthrodesis is still an option if TAR fails....it is not that simple. To have that fixed can literally take a year or more. Age and healing of bones etc. is also in your case perhaps more of a factor than in mine, but you will have to talk to an experienced medical practitioner about the options. Also lots of information on the internet. Just remember whatever you decide, after-care and complete healing is the number one factor for success. To accomplish that, you have to be manic about letting your ankle heal 100% completely before you put weight on it. I am serious, you can sort out any stiffness etc. afterwards but just let that thing heal completely. To give your body the best chance of healing, you have to abide by the rules of good healthy living by eating healthy food and to absolutely NOT smoke any tobacco. (Smoking retards bone growth up to 2.7 fold)"
"I will report back when I have more clarity on my position end of this month and I wish you all the best Viki. Please let me know what is happening on your side also. One has to prevent amputation at all cost, I believe, but when it comes to a certain point in ones life, it may be the best option to regain the joy of life you may have had to give up due to the condition of your ankle. I will however explore all possible options before I settle for amputation though."
"Regards"

"Thank you for your in-depth reply. Fortunately, I've eaten organic for forty years. Though I smoke loose organic roll your own cigarettes, I have to stop. I use systemic enzymes and understand horsetail herb promotes bone healing. It us the time of healing that gets me, but am so glad you do not regret yours."
"Take care."
"I look forward to your rrply. God Speed."

"Hi"
"I had the Zimmer Trabecular TAR done in 2014."
"In the past I have taken a look at the in-bone system and I guess it may well be the only possible option for me, as far as a ""revision"" of my TAR is concerned. Not sure if it is done in my country but I will certainly ask the question end of this month. It seems to me like the only TAR that has the strength and agility to hold up to the forces at play in an ankle."
"Regards"
"I would like to estabish contact with anyone who has undergone ankle replacement surgery and reflect a ittle on the aftereffects and the longer term prognoses for recovery and mobility."
"Having undergone such an operation about 9 months ago I am currently coming to terms with a less than welcome (and certainly unexpected) imapct upon my life and mobility."
"Issues such as lack of mobility, excessive swelling and cronic pain from the ankle itself but also from the toes and lack of sensation and feeling in parts of the foot are those I am facing and would like to know how other poeple have fared, both in the short and longer term."

"I am amazed that you got discharged with a Zimmer Frame!. The frame is only for the duration of the operation and they do “hammer” in the prosthesis but the fractured Fibula is not because of that. To get in the joint from the side they have to take the Fibula out of the way. I also have had this done…but no frame and the plate is a bit in the way. I had lots of ice on it for the first 14 days and no pins and needles etc. Very little swelling and I can walk short distances in the house. It is now 1 month."

"Recovery is approx 1 year to do all you want with vitual pain free. Time is the only healer. Ankles are not knees"
"A Small bone is taking all your weight. Get in to an Aircast boot as soon as possible and keep it on 24/7 for 6-8 weeks. Use both crutches for10 weeks then 1 crutch for last two weeks"
"After that walk through the pain barrier with no crutch. I am currently walking through that pain barrier and trying to resist pain killers. If only I had know what I was letting myself in for."

"My husband had a total ankle replacement surgery back in July of 2013. He has had nothing but chronic pain since. He says the ankle itself hurts on the inside and also the fibula he also has swelling around the ankle to his toes. I was reading your story and you specifically talk about a boot and something else that you were getting from the hospital? Can you please tell me the name of the boot and other thing you are talking about. I am so desperate to get him some help but the doctors here say everything looks fine. But for someone to be in this chronic pain there is something wrong. Thank you for all the help you can offer."
"Hi Rhonda,"
"It's called an Air boot which is like a big plastic cast with neoprene lining, the front comes away and is all held together with Velcro straps. Inside the boot is generally 3 little air bags that you can pump up to fit and secure your leg... Hence the term 'air' boot"
"Hi Rhonda1970"
"It is terrible the Dr's telling you ""everything looks great there isn't anything wrong anymore. But they're not the ones dealing with it. I have all kinds of nerve damage. I've also heard you don't have an ankle anymore so it can;t be hurting. you start thinking you're crazy.the Dr.s say you can't be hurting but you know your hurting really bad."
"I had my TAR in England on Aug 13th this year. They managed to break the fibula in the process too, so I also have a plate screwed in. I was non weight bearing for 5 weeks, then was given a 'moon boot' to wear for a week, to begin weight bearing then told to get into a shoe. I found the swelling I had been getting over toes while in plaster moved to ankle joint once I was out of the plaster, and initially it was very bad. I found the base of my foot quite rigid so took a walk with crutches along firm wet sand in bare feet. This enable to foot to begin to give a little while being totally supported. I also got a tennis ball and used that to roll around under my foot - it broke down some of the crytalising I felt. I have now been in a well supporting shoe - a trainer, for 10 days now and although I still get swelling it is nothing compared to the start. I have lots of pins and needles, most where the skin has sloughed off but also generally around the foot. I am beginning to get rotational movement now too. I have arranged to see a physio next week so I can find out how much movement I can practice non weight bearing."
"I also contacted a homeopathic clinic and they sent me a remedy to help reduce the pins and needles and burning type sensations and also the swelling, so that might be a route you might consider. I haven't tried ice but will see what physio suggests next week. I have also dropped to one crutch and at some times in the house have none. I find walking on carpets easier that hard floors, and when I do sit down I do elevate the foot but try to remember to keep moving it every few minutes. Hope this helps"
"Thanks so much for the suggestions! Wish I were closer to the beach...a walk in the sand sounds like it would be great. I will definitely try the tennis ball...sounds like it might be very helpful. Defintely try the ice...it really helps reduce the swelling, if only temporarily. Agree about moving the foot every couple of minutes...it really does help!"
"Thank you for the information and the outlook of all this with the TAR. May I ask which ankle did they use? The STAR or the Talaris? What kind of boot or shoes do you wear? My husbands doctor told us that total recovery was 3 months....""Go figure"" ""I just want his Chronic Pain of his to go away"" It has effect his whole life including our relationship... Depression, side effects for the pain medication."
"I'm 40 years old and live in italy. I had total ankle replacement in Bologna in Rizzoli ospital about 3 months ago."
"The device is a zimmer with lateral introduction and I have a good feeling with her."
"Unfortunately, for my precedent surgery , my skin on foot area is no good and the implant has caused a pressur ulcer and now I am fighting to close this."
"Pain decreased on ankle side but I have a problem with swelling."
"Now I walking whitout sticks but not for long time, i hope that this situetion will improve."
"In the another precedent surgery I did a transplant ankle but I don't racommend this because result is uncertain and the time of post op. has no end."
"If your alternative surgery is an transplant , contact me and I will not be recommending ever after."
"Good luck and keep in touch."
"I am doing lots of research and I think my two favorites are the Zimmer and the Hintermann Hintegra."
"Lots of opinions on these."

"I had TAR because of an accident in 1988 which saw the onset of osteoarthritis within a year or so and eventual bone-on-bone pain which, by 2010 had become at times unbearable (at other times you would hardly know I had the condition) and was managed with painkillers. After I turned 50 in 2013, my surgeon acknowledged how debilitating the pain had become and agreed to perform the TAR."
"5 months on now I have regular physio and can walk with a slight limp and – most days – moderate pain on the medial side. For around three to four months I suffered numbness and pins-and-needles across the top of the foot and in the big toe. This has almost eradicated now thankfully."
"This is all rather relatively good news; however, some days (today hence my web research and finding this forum) I am in severe pain and walk very gingerly with a pronounced limp. The pain is intense down the inside of the ankle (medial). It is not in the same place as before the op (that was at the bottom of the shin in the centre where the foot extends from) and is different. It is more a constant ache with aching ‘spikes’ rather than the breath-taking burning sensation I experienced before. There is some swelling although this does vary depending on how much walking I have done the day before (never much walking in truth)."
"Balance on the replaced ankle leg is difficult and physio seems to be a really long haul in that each week I seem to experience a slight improvement but then seem to stiffen up again prior to the next week’s session."
"Overall I am slightly disappointed that I continue to be in pain after 5 months and that the movement in the ankle is quite restricted still. My surgeon has said that there is a possibility I could look at having my Achilles tendon ‘cut’ but that is something for the future rather than consideration now."
"I have to reserve judgement at this stage as it is still relatively early days but I remember that after the original (very nasty injury requiring screws and plates) injury I was in less pain after 5 months. Of course, I was a heck of a lot younger then and a bit lighter too (although the op has spurred me on and I have lost 30lb and am in relatively good shape now)."
"To sum up then: slight disappointment at this stage perhaps due to enhanced expectations (self enhancement as my surgeon has always indicated a steady path to recovery) but happier with the pain I am enduring now vis-à-vis the pain I had before the op!"
"would eventually fuse themselves so decided on a replacement. I am 8 weeks post op now with a general ache all around the ankle and numbness. Only using one crutch and sometimes none at home for short distances."
"Cautiously optimistic 😕"
"Hi"
"I hope things are getting better, I'm 53 and had the replaement Nov 15. Balance is an issue for me but I'm working on the strengh in the foot."
"Apart from that I'm fine, can move the foot almost as much as the good one and walk fine, very little pain - I've not taken any pain killers for about 6 months now."
"Good luck I hope things get better soon"
"I am a 51 year old male and have had a TAR on 6 Oct 2014. My foot is still swollen a little bit but the rest is 100% normal. I am also a bit at a loss where comes to how much mobility and use I will eventually have of my ankle but going at this rate I am very optimistic. The chronic pain I had is gone and I only endure mild discomfort at this stage. I can move my ankle pretty far up and down and would roughly say I am almost where I was before the operation in terms of movement. I can also walk without any support, although only for a while. What I have discovered is that one tends to walk to the outside with the foot with the damaged ankle before the replacement and this shortens the ligaments a lot. I now have to deal with these muscles and tendons that did not work properly for a number years. It is a painful process to stretch the ligaments and muscles and it is going to be time consuming but if you work hard on doing some exercises and if your operation was done correctly, you should end up with a good result. For me the key is rehabilitation and the more you do that the better the result will be. I am also not sure about a 9 month time period and where one should be by then. I will for interest sake report back from time to time for comparative reasons."
"Another factor obviously is the type of procedure that was performed. In my case I had the Zimmer Trabecular metal implant that is done from the outside of the ankle and from the front. It has less impact on the tissue and nerves. It's a pretty new procedure and not many people in my country has had it done. I live in South Africa. The bad part is having to have to deal with a broken Fibula (joined with a metal plate) as that is part of the procedure."
"I also have a replaced hip for 7 years now, feels 100% the same as the other one. Maybe age does play a role where it comes to joint replacements and the younger you are the better your chances of full recovery. I was 44 when I lost my hip."
"Regards"
"I replay in this forum to you because you are very recent case of TAR, and I am just about to be a new case. However, all the cases reported I read here are important, and I have to say that I am not new to ankle chronic pain. About 12 years ago I had an ankle surgery (sports related) that essentially ""gave me arthitis"" in the process. Ever since the procedure I have pain/stiffness in my left ankle, which is aggraveted by constant swelling around the ankle joint. I have so-called wheater induced pain, I can tell when a storm will come some three-four days in advance, not a pleasant way to become popular among friends. I am just about to turn 60 yo and I've got to the point to quit being a human barometer, but I know well that the ansiety of having yet another foot surgery can be troublesome."
"I am here to seek encouragment, I know many people have had bad experiences with TAR one way or the other but I think if we have humble expectations and be prepared for a realively long recovery from the surgery we may overcome all issues."
"I don't have yet the detais on the procedure, but my doctor says it might be beneficial in my case (I already did MRI and now will schedule a CATscan), just that right now I have butterflies in my stomach thinking about the expectations. I will return to this forum and report often, hopefuly with good news for all."
"Best regards,"
"My surgeon told me last week that as the dynamics of the ankle has changed, the weight redistribution has meant that the medial side is growing bone to take the weight. This, apparently, is where the pain eminates from as the new nerves in the fresh bone settle!"
"Stick with it and be patient!"
"Scott."
"What I am trying to say is that not all ankles are suited to be replaced and it may especially be true in the case where one has had previous surgery which may have had an effect on the ligaments etc. From what I gathered with my surgeon is that for TAR you actually need a very good stable ankle. One must remember that there are three joints in your ankle and only one gets replaced. If the other is in good nick, then you will benefit much by having the one worn out joint replaced. Obviously the opposite is also the case if you have other problems in your ankle as well. One thing you must make sure of is that your surgeon must know TAR very well and he must be able to perform it with great skill. In terms of what prosthesis to choose, I was scheduled for a Tornier Prosthsis and a couple of days before the surgery the surgeon decided to use the Zimmer Trabicular Metal prosthesis. It cost almost double of what I was quoted for the other one but he said that I was more suited for the latter prosthesis and I went with his decision. Looking back, I am glad it was done from the side as having a wound in front of your foot must be very uncomfortable with the movement and stretching of the muscles when you walk….but I am not an expert and I in no way suggest or give any advice in terms of the pro’s and con’s as far as the different procedures and prosthesis’s are concerned. I only speak from my own experience."
"It’s now just past 7 weeks and I am back at work. I don’t wear my moonboot anymore. I try to walk as normal (foot forward) as possible but I only manage small(ish) steps but hoping to stretch them soon. I do my exercises and it is accompanied by a little bit of pain and discomfort. I drive our automatic car and I walk with about the same limb as before…but this time I know it’s going to get better and not worse. I don’t have any of the pain I had before and I sleep very well. I used to suffer from “still pain” at night when I was sleeping….nothing of that. Does it come with challenges?. Absolutely yes. I had some signs of a reaction which looked like infection on the surface of my wound. I had to take a course of antibiotics for it. At this stage I do have a possible recurrence of it but I am keeping an eye on it. Nothing to worry about the surgeon assured me as it does sometimes happen when the dissolvable stiches inside starts to dissolve your body attacks it. After 6 weeks I had x-rays taken and everything is 100% in order….good news."
"I hope this helps and if you have doubt, maybe you can get hold of a second opinion. That is what I did and it made a huge difference."
"Thanks for your kind words. Speaking in retrospective, my last surgery (which I consider a bad one) was also a long recovery, I remember being about eight months to a year of pain and discomfort, particularly during major change in weather. Today the weather is still an issue for me, and the swelling also is constantly there. My mobility has always been compromised, since childhood in fact, so I am no stranger to it, but against all odds I actually regain strength and returned to sports - karate (call me crazy!) and achieved a brown belt level. I do not do contact sports or running anymore but still do bicycling which does not cause me any problem. in 2012 I completed MS (multiple sclerosis) 150 challenge from Houston to Austin and I felt very proud about my contribution to the cause."
"I believe human beings can achieve quite impossible goals, if one sets the mind and believe it, despite of any disability. Today I have other goals beyond athletics, essentially I want to remain healthy and moderately active for the rest of my existance, and I just hope that this new procedure will not be an impediment to all."
"As for the expectation to be back to work, I also consider a 7-week period an acceptable time. Before this forum the recovery time notion was just a cloudy one. My surgeon express confidently that ""it will not be long"" but again I will make sure to discuss further with him."
"I understand and am prepared to accept one thing about my case, that my foot mobility may not change much from what it is now. My highest expectations though are that the struggle with pain (I do sympathize with ""still pain at night"") will decrease and impairment to walking will improve somewhat afterwards, if I gain these assurances I will consider a major victory!"
"My regards and the best of recovery to us all."
"A quick update from me."
"It has been about 15 weeks now after my TAR. The last X rays were taken 7 January 2015. My surgeon saw it and he is satisfied that all is well and in place, except for the healing of the Fibula. That bone is still a long way from healed and there is a pretty big gap between the joints where it was cut thru. The metal plate is keeping it pretty well in place. According to my surgeon this will heal in time, so I am not too worried. I will be a liar if I say that I don't have any pain though. Walking is still not as easy as I have hoped it to be by now, but maybe I am just being impatient. Most of my pain is around my ankle and the joint itself certainly is painless. I have an appointment with a biokineticist this coming week to start rehabilitation. I am convinced that the pain originates from the tissues and ligaments surrounding my ankle and not the prosthesis itself. I have walked for many years with my foot to the outside and that has affected my ankle tissues as well as the ligaments. I hope with some treatment and the right exercises the ligaments will loosen up as well. I don't have any of those ""still pain"" spells at night anymore and I can walk, sometimes with a limb and sometimes almost normal, but my ankle gets tired quite quickly and it hates uneven surfaces. I have also had a build-up of liquid in my leg and when I wear socks for instance, they tend to press a deep ring around my leg. I am being treated for the condition now. I am now having problems in my other ankle as well. It means another 1000 km trip to my surgeon soon unfortunately. At least not the same problems with the as the first ankle, but I will need keyhole surgery in my other ankle in future also."
"For now I am hanging in there and I am back at work, climbing three storey’s every day up and down."
"Regards"
"Just little over a month after my TAR. Like your case, my doctor was very pleased with the result and told me to start PT right away, which I am doing now for the past three weeks, combined with home exercises. I am curious to learn how your prothesis ""looks like"", when I saw my X-Ray for the first time I was surprised by how small it looks inside my new ankle joint! It extends just about 1.5 inch or so from top to bottom, including both titanium pieces and the ""plastic"" bearing in between. The Ti pieces were screwed in, but I barely notice them."
"As far as pain and swelling, I think we are equal (swelling and liquids) and the pain is very minimum, more like a discomfort around the surgery area. Now the stiffness bothers me quite a lot, then again I always had a pretty stiff achilis tendon since previous operations, but I am working hard with my PT person to stretch what I can. At this time I can step on and put weight on the foot, but still wear a hard boot and have to sleap with another ligher one just to keep the foot from bending forward. Other then all this, I am very optimistic for my recovery, I know it will take time but I already had my mind and spirit prepared for this, and I encourage you to be patient as well."
"As a last note, sorry to hear that your hospital is so far away (mine is just about 10 km!), I think I just got lucky to find the right place and the right doctor so close. I now commute to work regularly, and I use a ""knee walker"" to move around the house and in my work building -this has been a tremendous help! but definitely would not work for climbing stairs, unfortunately."
"I hope this is of any help to you - my 6 weeks Xrays. Very small pieces of metal indeed."

"I am glad you also think it looks great, my ankle has been feeling rather good the last couple of days too. There is no screws attached to the prothesis itself, only to the plate that keeps the Fibula in place. I went for the evaluation at the biokineticist today. According to him there is 100% movement in terms of the angles I foot can manage. We are starting our progran tomorrow evening. We are going to strengthen my leg as the main origin of the discomfort comes from the ligaments surrounding the ankle and they in turn are connected higher up in my leg. So! it's back to the old gym room for me now."

"My next challenge - back to road bicycling! but in due time ."
"I must point out to you that I live in the US and my surgery was done here in quite a local (but excellent) hospital called Memorial Herman, in Katy, Texas, a near suburb of Houston. I am not sure if it is appropriate revealing my surgeon's name here, but I do anyway because I do have great trust in the person as a professional. His name is Dr. William McGarvey, you can google him and find out more about his medical profession."
"I think you know exactly the whole history, as time went by the procedure of TAR became way much better. If you follow our stories here you will probably notice the results from all recent TAR patients and be able to learn the difference from past experiences. I am a total advocate for the modern TAR! surely the recovery is slow but the alternatives (fusion, living with pain) are far worse!"
"If America is not a deterring stop for you to South Africa, I would recommend a consultation here. Houston is not a glamorous city but we certainly have excellent hospitals!"
"All the best in your health progress."
"G.M."
"I am from SA and had the same problem in my ankle as well as with my local surgeon not being able to perform TAR operations in Bloemfontein. I went to Cape Town and had a consultation with Dr. Jason Crane. I asked him one question after the examination of my ankle..""If this was your ankle, what will you do?"" and he replied ""Replace it"" and so he did. I was down there last week for a follow-up. My ankle is not perfect...yet, but Dr. Crane was very happy and impressed by the progress so far, I have almost 100% movement and fixation etc. It's only going on 6 months and I have much less pain than what I had before the TAR. I can recommend him to you as I have practical experience of his capabilities. I just could not face the idea of a stiff ankle ...my story is on here somewhere and having a replaced hip also made my decision a little bit easier I suppose."
"Regards"
"Leon"
"Best of luck with that hip of yours and happy Easter."
"Alta"
"We can stay in touch, no problem with it."
"I was referred to an Orthotist by my surgeon to try and correct my ankle's angle with an inner sole for my shoe. I am actually ending up two of them, one in each shoe. I was amazed to learn that these practitioners can actually do a lot with their knowledge of the joints and how to place your foot in a correct walking position. It rather made me wonder where I would have been if I went to this particular person ten years ago. Maybe he could have preserved my ankle by spreading the weight evenly thru an insert in my shoe/s years ago?. Much of our problems starts with old injuries but it get's compounded by us walking the wrong way and in the process damaging cartilage and precious bone tissue. According to the Orthotist, I will have to learn to walk correct and do a lot of exercise's that he gave me. It's all about getting the lines straight and not letting the Achilles tendons ""shrink"" ."
"In retrospect, if I had a choice now and if my ankle was still in tact ..even only sort of, I would have been 100% behind the Orthotist trying to correct the ankle without surgery. One should investigate every avenue of treatment before going for surgery, that is my opnion."
"Regards"
"Leon"
"Now I just passed my third month since my TAR procedure. My expectations surpass my frustrations, in the sense that I keep optimistic about little (I do mean little) improvements that I note every day. I feel like 95% ok. I stopped PT at the hospital and continue exercises on my own. Ankle stiffness and swelling still persist as my worse burden, plus minor discomfort/pain while walking. I dicovered that going downsteps on staircases is the most cumbersome move I do. The other day I tried to put on my longneck rubber garden boots and discovered that my foot does not flex downward enough to pass through the neck! so I had to do garden work on my regular tennis shoes."
"All these little discoveries make up for my little frustrations, then again considering not living with major ankle pain is the main reward to me. Therefore I keep my optimism high, and I just wish I could do more to gain further mobility. I know now I cannot be better than before (mobility wise), at least I want to be equal."

"I am glad you are ok and hanging in there."
"I have much appreciation for your little frustrations and I have come across many of them myself. In a sense I think I am fortunate though in that I really have 99.99% movement in my ankle, painless non-bearing. I in fact have more movement than what I have in the other ankle. I also suffer with a swollen leg (water) but my surgeon said it will clear up in time. I have a sock that I wear, pretty stiff one and it helps to keep swelling to a minimum. Sometimes I can walk normally and sometimes my ankle is just plain common painful....especially on rainy days. Fortunately where I live, rain is not something we have often so that is ok."
"I work on the 3rd floor and no lift available here so climbing stairs up and down has become second nature to me. I agree, getting down stairs is a bigger challenge than going up. I tend to climb “flat foot” down stairs using the middle to hind part of my foot. Climbing up stairs actually renders me the opportunity for some exercise using the front part of my foot and stretching the Achilles tendons."
"I am awaiting inner soles for my shoes and from what I have read on the web, they make a huge difference so bear that option in mind also."
"I am on 6 months now and progress is really slow, but every day is a blessing without that pain I suffered for so many years before the TAR. That is a relief and I also appreciate that a lot. I can walk much easier than what it would have been with a Fusion so I am way past the point where I had doubts regarding whether I made the right decision or not."

"Always a pleasure hearing from you and know of your progress. The mobility problem was something I already had prior to this surgery, in fact since childhood when I had my very first achilis operation. Everything went downhill ever since, I admit mostly due to my own ingnorance and not doing proper exercises and PTs. For that, my tendon today is as stiff as a broomstick, lots of scar tissues or fibrosis enveloping the achilis area, so I could not possibly expect any mobility improvement beyond what I was and that is that."
"Regardless, today, just like you, I feel blessed for my TAR results, no regrets at all here, also a great change in attitute and respect for my own body is what keeps my spirit up."
"Best regards,"
"Gilbert"
"Good to see things are well with you."
"I am on a mission lately to see if I can get as much as possible ""normality"" back in my ankle and that entails a change in attitude as well as lifestyle."
"I am doing exercises early in the morning now and it really makes my ankle more tolerant for the rest of the day. I have found the two most valuable exercises to be the one where you fold a towel into a thin(ish) shape (8 fold in my case), hook it in the middle with the front part of your foot and pull on both sides. This really stretches the Achilles tendon to the limit. The other one is where you place your foot about 60 mm from a wall and then bend your leg forward trying to touch the wall with your knee keeping your heel down on the floor. I could not get near the wall and now it’s easy and I am actually moving my foot 10mm backwards. Takes some patience though but I can feel the results. I am very fortunate in that I have not had any form of surgery prior to the TAR and although my tendon is shortened by not walking correctly, I am positive that I can reverse the situation in time doing the exercises. I also use a silicon band for resistance exercises to the sides or my ankle."
"I am still waiting for the inner sole’s at this stage but I am hopeful that they will also assist me by aligning both my ankles in a normal position and thus placing less stress on the prosthesis when I walk."
"I will report back when I have the sole’s in and let you know how/if they make a difference…hopefully a positive difference."
"Regards"

"I have also gone on a mission lately to see if I can get as musch as possible ""normality"" back and that entails a change in attitude as well as lifestyle. I am doing excersizes"
"As I posted previously I had my TAR on 3rd December 2014, so maybe time for an update."
"I now have no pain whatever in my foot and ankle when walking on flat ground, albeit I still lack the flexibility needed to walk comfortably up and down hills. My biggest problem has been the incidental loss of muscle mass and strength resulting froom three increasingly inactive years preceding TAR, and confinement to a cast and boot for 7 weeks during recovery. This is most noticeable in the affected calf which lost 20cm in diameter and was almost bereft of any muscle definition.100 tiptoe lifts each morning and night (whilst cleaning my teeth!) helped restore my calves quite quickly, but thighs and buttocks remained a bigger problem, especially for a man of 240 pounds."
"However, last weekend I stayed on my feet continuously for 4 hours to walk a total of about 4 miles on mixed ground including up and down hills and finished none the worse for wear. In fact, I feel the expedition has greatly improved my strength and flexibility."
"So having used the elastic straps for weeks I feel it is now a question of putting my ankle to normal use to complete my recovery, which I seems to me to be good progress less than 5 months after such radical surgery."
"Good luck to all"
"Best"

"My TAR procedure was just little less than one month after yours, like you, no joint pain anymore but I am feeling some sort of ""fatigue strain"" as best as I can describe, around the joint I think due to tendon stretching excercises I am doing. I stopped PT at the hospital but continue on my own. Also like you, I loss muscle mass in my left calf, but this was from my childhoot first achilis surgery (8 weeks cast!), a tremendous lesson learned to anyone who for some reason is forced to keep immobilized for too long - muscles rarely return to original form. Even today (I am 60) I cannot do lifting on my toes, or stading on my heel over an edge (stair case), I do not have that muscle to sustain my weight."
"Leon described his routine for stretching, here is mine 1- In the morning I go to the staircase, use the rails for support and do similar stretch excersices. bending my knee and ankle in ""Z"" forward, then after elongate the left leg back (now the right leg makes the Z) and stretch further the left achilis. 2- standing on ball of feet over the staircase edge and holding rail I do (my best attempt) 20 liftings, then do tendon stretch by pushing my left ankle down and holding for 30 seconds each time. 3- walking down steps (right foot first, in my specific case) and then climb the steps backwards (left foot first ) - always holding the rail for support. This routine takes me about 20 min. to complete. At home, while watching TV on the couch, I use a strong elastic band wrapped around the ball of the foot and do ankle flexing. I also use a towel in the same fashion as John."
"I really enjoy having this conference with you guys, I think it is helping all of us to overcome our common difficulties. Contine sharing the grace."
"Gilbert"
"I am glad to see you all are doing much the same type of exercises. At least we know we are on the right track!."
"At work I have three storey’s to climb, Monday to Friday so I do my “stair’s” exercises sort of on my way to the office."
"I also have varying kinds for pain in my ankle and always when load bearing. No pain in a resting position. My gait is very close if not 100%. Maybe it has something to do with the weather, I don’t know but when we have rain on the way I have a more sensitive ankle (and hip). I also suffer rather quickly from that fatigue feeling when I put on too much stain on the joint. This is one thing I hope will also improve in time so that I can have a bit more stamina. I went to the beach when I was in the Overberg region a few weeks ago, really suffered on the uneven sandy beach and I opted to sit and look at the waves instead of walking on the beach. That is very unlike me and it made me realize that a TAR does come with certain limitations, although I like to think its all temporary at this stage."
"One has to put in as much as possible in the first year and that will determine how much (or less) of a normal life you lead for the foreseeable future."
"Leon"
"From another old beach boy, my sympathies in regards to uneven grounds! Way before, when I had the other operation which actually bogged my ankle down and gave me athritis, I remember the uneasy feeling trying to walk on soft beach sands. Other similar issues when travelling to Europe, street cobblestones! It is a whole learning process once we have ankle ailment. Now since my TAR I tend to refrain from walking over uneven surfaces, which is a very difficult thing to avoid depending where you go. The worse for me still is climbing down steps though."
"I truly hope that I will see some evolution into this TAR recovery period, speaking of mobility. That will be a bonus to me, since the main reason to go through the ordeal was to be rid of joint pain - ditto accomplished."
"G."
"Many thanks and regards"
"Getting onto those exercises tomorrow tho.😉"
"All in all, I do not have any regrets. I do not have the chronic pains from before, I can travel and work without fear of weather changes, and I keep my excercise routine almost religiously."

"I would like to estabish contact with anyone who has undergone ankle replacement surgery and reflect a ittle on the aftereffects and the longer term prognoses for recovery and mobility."

"I'm 52 years old and have to make a decsion whether to have my ankle fused or have it replaced. At the moment due to various previous operations a natural propensity towards arthritis my ankle is significantly impared and my mobility has lessened over time to the point it is almost rigid. I've been told by the specialsit that a fusion is prefered because of my age and that I might even expericne a slight gain in mobility. I'm not convinced. I've lost work due to my lack of mobility and it has made work far more difficult not being able to move. I realsie that if I do elect for the ankle replacement that I won't be running or jumping anytime soon but could get back to being able to walk some distance eventually without too much pain and cope with uneven surfaces. The other thing that I was told that I was really too young to be thinking about a replacement and that they only last for about ten years has anyone else been told this or heard this. Is the potentinal pain and inital recovery and rehab discomfort worth it overall?"
"I'm 55 now and had my right ankle replaced 2 years ago, and it is the best decision I’ve made. I was like you not sure what to do. I looked into the fusion first and I thought this is the last resort option, I wanted movement in my ankle as I wanted to ski and a fusion will not give you this. The ankle replacement will give you movement, I am able to walk on uneven ground, sand, rocks and do most things I could do before my arthritis set in, the only thing I can’t do is run. I saw about 3 consultants the first said I will end up with a fusion and showed me an x ray of a fused ankle with two bolts through it, this put me off straight away. The second did keyhole surgery (Ankle Arthroscopy) to clean the ankle joint and then had Cortisone Injections and I felt both of these were a waste of time and he said he would only do a fusion. So I went to see his partner for a second opinion and he agreed to do the replacement. And I haven’t looked back! I do not have any pain just a bit stiff if I haven’t moved for a while but this frees up after a few steps, I ski on it hard and fast! No jumps or bumps. I just after it. I kept reading you have to be old to have a replacement this is not true, I’ve read on the internet people of early 20’s having this done. 10 years is the average life time for a replacement, for me that’s 10 years of movement! But they say that about a hip and they can last for 20 years. My consultant said in 10 years time he will be able to re-place a replacement if not then you can have a fusion. Remember if you have a fusion you can’t have a replacement. Your ankle might be too far damaged to have a TAR (Total Ankle Replacement)"
"I was in a cast for 4 weeks then in a plastic air boot for another 6 weeks then went to physiotherapy for 10 weeks by then I was walking pretty well with hardly any pain, it took a year for me to fully recover and it’s worth the wait."
"You are not too old, you need to find a consultant who is willing and has done over 50 ankle replacements. Find out what replacement he uses as there are loads out there, I had the mobility by depuy but the best (I thought)was the hintegra system at the time. All I can say is research, read the forums ask questions look at both options, fusions are common and you will find someone with one."
"Hope this helps."
"fishersid"
"Hi I'm 53 - I had my TAR Nov 2015 and I'm very happy with it - I was also told by 5 surgeons I could only have fusion and I'm so glad I said NO."
"I can do everything I used to - don't run but can jog - I walk 18 holes of golf and do 3 flights of stairs all day at work."
"I can move the new ankle almost as much as the old 53 year old one lol"
"I believe a positive attitude is important and the right phyiso."
"Best thing I did, do your research. I've been told ten years the same as everyone else but my surgeon also said ""who Knows"" there not that common here in the UK. Lets see."
"Steve"
"Hi - Thanks for the advice, i think that the idea of running was a little ambitious."
"I've been thinking a lot this week and been reading a lot on here and an american FB ankle replacment site."
"The trade off between being classed as a fully fit officer on the front line and the health of my ankle has been a very hard choice for me, I'm very stubourn, It's not that I want to be on the streets chassing crim's, those days are long gone - but not being a fully fit officer reduces the work I can (allowed) to do, at the moment I have my old job still investigating crimes but also been told this week I can't stay in that role anymore and I'm being moved."
"I DO understand some of the reasons but I also work with a few people who after the three flights of stairs have to rest before they can talk, I do them easy - just seems wrong somewhat but thats the system."
"It's amazing how much just a small joint can effect your whole life but the difference in the pain from walking bone on bone for so long is fantastic."
"I've had a lot of comunication this week ( I was starting to think I was the only one in the country to have a replacment ) and so refreshing to hear the recovery stories from so many on here."
"All the best"

I am feeling a little desperate... and it seems the more research on Doctors i do the more confused i become... thank in advance for your advice and comments.."

"Dear Edmund"
"The key to a successful TAR is your choice of surgeon. Whether or not you actually like them should not be a factor but their PROVEN competence judged by the success long term of their TAR replacements."
"I had a TAR five years ago and whilst I made a good recovery and returned to a pretty physically demanding job I'm now having to have the prosthesis removed and a replacement installed!"
"This is because of osteolysis and the fact that is was badly positioned which is likely to have caused the problem. Google Yogesh total ankle replacement and you will be able to watch a short video of me walking on different surfaces and running up and down stairs at twenty weeks."
"The right surgeon will select the prosthesis for you based on a number of factors. Good luck. Richard"
"Cheers Richard"
"Jean2018: I agree with what RichardKen said. The choice of prosthesis is not the key here. Your choice of surgeon is the key. Each surgeon uses the prosthesis he/she is experienced and comfortable with. The personality of the doctor is not nearly as important as his/her skill. Of course no one wants a surgeon with the personality of a mule. I believe you are correct in interviewing as many doctors as you need to before making the decision. This is your body. This is very complicated surgery, that, if not done correctly will haunt you. However, the surgery can be very successful if done by the right set of hands. I would have had Dr DiGiovanna at Mass General do it, but I live 6 hours away. I don't know where in Connecticut you live, but if it is only a couple hours away, go to Mass General to the surgeon you like. I am in Syracuse and traveled 2 hours to Rochester for my surgeon. While the travel for post op visits is a pain, esp in the snow we get, I am pleased with my decision and would not have chosen a local surgeon that I was not confident of just for the sake of less travel."
"I am 71 years old. I had a right TAR with STAR prosthesis along with subtalar fusion 11/2016. The TAR is pain free, but the subtalar fusion has a ways to go. I had a left TAR 12/17 and I only have occasional discomfort, essentially pain free. In my rehab, which I am doing on my own at home, I am up to a 30 minutes vigorous workout on an elliptical and a 15 minute light workout on treadmill (at a slow pace). I am far from walking normally, but I am happy with where I am at this stage 10 weeks out. My biggest limitations are not the TAR's but my knees: right knee needs replacement and left knee was replaced in 2011, but the workout helps both of those as well. The worst part of the surgery for me was 6 weeks of no weight bearing. I found that those 6 weeks along with the past year of less exercise due to my arthritis left my legs very weak, and it is taking a lot of time to build my leg strength back up. And it takes a lot of focus to do that much work. Don't expect the surgery to give you new legs. The surgery helps the joints, but the muscles and tendons need to be built back up, and that takes many months of hard work. The surgery is just the start of the process. The rest is up to you."
"I am doing well enough that my wife and I are leaving next week to take the second leg of our cross country trip from San Francisco to Syracuse over 2 months (we did a 6,000 mile trip east to west in our van last fall)."
"Good luck"
"Congratulations on your progress! When I was told that I would have to go through a repeat recovery I was really p***ed off because as you know it is a long boring recovery until one is weight bearing. I hated being unable to carry food and drinks around but have been practicing with an iWalk 2.0 hands free crutch which will give me back this ability and keep some of my muscles active on the operated side"
"Cheers Richard"
"I kept a cloth bag hung over the handlebar of my knee walker. I kept all my important belongings in that: meds, tissues, nuts to munch on, coffee, tea, and water in a sealed thermos, stretch band, wound bandages, ipad, eyeglasses, extra contact lenses, nail clippers, toothbrush and toothpaste, and much more. I learned to carry my bowl of cereal in the morning with one hand and navigate the knee walker with the other. The contents of that bag were as mysterious as my wife's pocketbook! I also at times learned that at times it is easier to crawl on all 4 on the floor pushing my plate of food in front of me. I learned the best way to navigate stairs is to sit on the step, and go up backward or down one step at a time on my butt: very easy and very safe. I hate to be waited upon. We all use our imagination to improvise"
"I had to look after myself and it was hard as the house was a very old house on several levels but I managed. I well remember at times as you did crawling whilst moving a plate of food. With the iwalk it will be very different....I hope! I will see in two weeks time."
"All the best Richard"
"understand that I had TAR on both sides. I had a subtalar fusion as well as TAR on the left, and that is different than an ankle fusion. I don't know how long it takes to recover from an ankle fusion, but it has taken over a year for me to recover from my subtalar fusion, whereas it has only taken me a couple months to recover from my TAR. Most ankle arthritis does not require a subtalar fusion. I was very symptomatic from my subtalar arthritis as well as my ankle joint arthritis, and therefore needed the subtalar fusion and TAR on the right: See references"

"Hi Jean: I've been diddling around trying to make a decision on surgeons to do a TAR. One surgeon utilizes the STAR replacement and the other utilizes the Zimmer. My retired orthopaedic cousin suggested going with the Zimmer. Both surgeons enjoy great reputations. I've decided to go with the Zimmer because several othopaedic surgeons won't use anything but Zimmer hips and knees and I believe there is less likelihood of nerve damage usinig the Zimmer (approached from the side of the ankle, repositioning the fibula); STAR surgery approach is from the front. I am a 70 year old female, pretty active, with Lupus and my conservative Zimmer surgeon isn't in favor of my doing a fusion."
"Another thing I learned yesterday when I had my third cortisone/medol injection is one cannot have surgery within the six month period after a steroid injection. So, my intent is to schedule TAR in August/September."
"Note 1: I had previous ankle surgery and did find going up and down stairs on my bottom worked best. Also helped to keep my arms toned."
"Note 2: 15 years ago I fell on ice and broke my fibula, sprained my ankle. Both surgeons believe the osteo arthritis accelerated because of that trauma."
"Thank you. I did a comparison. and the Zimmer looks like the most anatomically correct on and the least invasive... The doctor says they last about 10 years and he uses the salto taloris unit... I'm just having a hard time of the thought of going back in after 10 years for a redo. At that time i will be 75.."

My scar is about 7-inch long, slightly left of center on my left leg. I will start physical therapy next week, as recommended, and I plan to return to work in two weeks.

"I had ankle replacement at Shirley Oaks Hospital, Croydon - 1 year ago."
"I had a great experiance and it's really going well. My surgeon explained that due to the bone on bone for so long it was a possability that I may wake with a fusion if he could not do the replacement, I had the replacment."

"Hi Peter, it sounds like you’ve been to hell & back. I can’t imagine living through what you’ve had to endure. I’ve had four surgeries on my left including a double ankle fusion & arch reconstruction. All failed. My right foot is as severe as the left but I don’t think I will do surgery. I now have carpel tunnel from living on crutches, walker & knee scooter for so long. I urge you to look into ExoSym brace. I’m fundraising right now to raise the money to get this. People who were considering amputation, partially amputated feet, club foot, failed ankle fusions, the list goes on & on how these braces have given people back their mobility. I’ve talked to several people who have them,I’m meeting up with one in the morning & these are people who had pretty well lost most of their mobility like us. They are out walking, running marathons & doing all the things I haven’t been able to do in years. Please research this for yourself. They sound like they’re to good to be true but they work. My heart goes out to you as I understand what you’re going through. These braces are my light at the end of this tunnel & they could be yours too. Let me know what you think. Stay strong Peter. Hang in there. Research these braces."
"Your story is sad, I do feel for you having to go through all the ordeal to rid yourself of pain. It is totally not fair that all attempts so far had failed in your case, but one has to keep up with good hope for better solutions and better medical technology advancement. In my case, 12 years ago I thought of TAR as a crazy thing, medical comments at that time was for merely hope of any improvement, and they only recommended for after ""old age"", meaning over 60s. Today I am 59yo, 5' 5"" tall and about 180 lb, I am sligthly overweight for my height. Now I do not know how ""20 stone"" translates into pounds, (perhaps 200lb?) which I think would be around the mark for yours over 6 feet tall."
"I say keep your hopes always up for better technologies and get more doctors opinions. I see you are in Europe, there you should not have much of a distance barrier to retain yourself from visiting foreing contries where things might be little more advanced, so please do not give up hope! recovery is in our reach, and Godspeed."

"I feel maybe I can inject a few positives into this discussion for those people contemplating this procedure."
"i had ankle replacement surgery on 3rd December 2014."
"Before that I was fairly mobile but very uncomfortable and concerned what the future would hold for me as a previously active 66 year old."
"My rheumatologist had concluded that I suffered severe and wiespread topacious gout as the result of being prescribed a massive long grrm course of a broad spectrum antibiotic (tetracycline) for a deep seated gastric infection, which caused joint damage especially in previously damaged joints like my right ankle and left shoulder."
"My specialist foot and ankle surgeon told me that the condition would soon deteriorate further and that if not done soon, ankle replacement would not be possible due to bone deterioration. As the option, fusion, was not attractive to me as a keen sailor needing to be able to stand on a sloping deck, I decided to go for TAR."
"Almost from the day of the operation I have had no pain except when I have overstressed the joint. This in itself has been a welcome and major benefit."
"I am now being weaned off the moonboot and beginning to walk unaided"
"PT is proving surprisingly (to me!) helpful and I am optimistic for the future."
"So far matters have progressed entirely as predicted, and I experience expected swelling and discomfort only when I attempt to do too much and don't elevate my footenough in these early days."
"I will contribute to this discussion again in a couple of months to advise progress."
"Your experience is so reasuring to us, recent TAR patients, thank you for sharing. It is sad to hear that your issue initiated by means of medication, indicated for other malady, thus serving as a warning for many."
"On the recovery side, all you describe I pair with you. My procedure was done in December 29 of 2014. The joint pain is gone! but the swelling is there still and I expect to continue for a while. My case differ a little because I alredy had many surgeries in my left leg prior to this one, so I had mobility problems and stiffness inherited from those. My PT sessions, as of now, only focus on foot range of movement, with (as I see) only little success. As in your case, swelling and discomfort spread when I do too much of standing on the foot. At work or home I try to keep my foot elevated, and I excercise and move my foot on every opportunity I get."
"I am very optimistic for my recovery and from the beginning I knew not to expect too much from this but getting rid of chronic pain. Somehow I feel I may get surprised and actually gain a little more mobility than before! an unexpected blessing in this case."
"We wil continue this progress contribution here."
"Cheers,"
"GM"
"you are nearly a month behind me in terms of your procedure date, and what you describe fairly matches where I was a month ago, so take heart."
"Today I have been out and about largely without crutches and drove my car for the first time, so very pleased."
"I am now right at the end of my day and a little achey but as my PT points out, TAR is a massive amount of surgery to such a complex and stressed joint, and the foot is the most prone to post op swelling."
"Several of my neighbours are surgeons and their advice very much supported a key finding of my personal research concerning the importance of the surgeons experience in this very demanding procedure. In this I was fortunate to find my local foot and ankle specialist had completed 70 successful TAR implants."
"But it sounds to me that you're doing at least as well as I, so every reason to be optimistic."
"Best"
"John"
"Indeed, we both are lucky to be around good specialist, my surgeon also has years of experience, besides being a man of research and science on the subject of implants. I think this is key for the success of such difficult procedure, however, our personal determination to heal the affected area is another very important component of the equation."
"I am also back on driving my car and going to work normally, I do not use crutches, instead I have a knee scooter, which is very handy at home and work as well. I don't have stairs to climb, that is also a plus in my case. But at home I do plenty of extra exercises beyond the PT at the hospital. Next week I will see my doctor again, I am anxious to hear what he plans for me on the next phase."
"all in all I am in good spirit in this healing process, I know I shouldn't expect miracles but all the little I get out of this (plus no longer feeling the arthritis pain!) is welcome to me."
"best regards,"
"Gilbert"
"March 29th will mark the third month since my ankle surgery. Since the second month I was already walking with moon boot and going to my regular PTs. I now wear normal shoes, PT continues and I all seems to be as expected for my recovery. I feel good about the results, but perhaps a little anxious about the swelling and slow walking. I feel some kind of strain pain in the muscles and tendons around the ankle as well, but this is most likely due to the PT workout, too. So far my worse dificulty is to walk down stair cases, when the ankle really bends and the tendons stretch."
"Other then that I have no reason to complain, just remembering how much pain I had before the surgery and now all I have to deal with is re-learn how to down down stairs! As far as my normal physical activities, my doctor told me I can go back into bicycling, which I intend to do soon when weather permits."
"Cheers to all, keeping a good attitude and positivity during our slow recovery."
"Gilbert"
"My 3 month mark was 3rd March and you are already at about where I am, And I am pretty pleased, so done."
"I also have muscle and tendon issue but this is due to wasteage and shrinkage dur a long period of limited use pre-op and 8 weeks in cast and boot, and at my age replacingost muscle in calves is aong slow process requiring regular exercises and I do 100 toe lifts every night and morning while cleaning my teeth! Climbing stairs an balls of feet and cycling is so good stuff"
"Best"
"John"
"Good thing you can be multi-task, doing toe lifts while cleaning teeth, I would probrably tend to bite the brush if I try this combination , anyway, I am determined to keep up with the exercises and PT at the hospital where they have the right equipment. At home I am limited to elastic bands and books I use for step exercise. My problem during the day is at work, where I stay sitting most of the time, my ankle resting on top of a cardboard box which does not provide enough lifting to help with the swelling. I tend to stand up and stretch and even walk to the building staircase to use the steps. My goal now is to be ready and fit for July, when I intend to go to Italy on vacation, there will be plenty of walking and standing on my feet then. I feel confident that all will be okay."
"All the best,"
"Gilbert"
"Theresa, I am SO sorry to hear of your pain. If you need drugs to help with the pain, you take them!"
"Your story has reinforced my decision to stick with the pain meds until I really can't walk and NOT have the surgery - at least not now. I don't think I want to have it ever, reading stories like yours."
"Good luck."
"Take care."
"Sandra"
"You are a strong person to endure your ankle pain. Many prayers and good wishes your way for strength and comfort. I am in week 8 of ankle replacement 8 screws plus a big toe plate and 3 screws and a tendon repaired. I have my walking boot, with crutches. Just starting work full time again. This ankle thing is scary. How does one know how much is too much or too little? Prayers for you Theresa. Talk to us here on this blog to keep up your spirits. People have great things to help here."
"I would like to estabish contact with anyone who has undergone ankle replacement surgery and reflect a ittle on the aftereffects and the longer term prognoses for recovery and mobility."
"Having undergone such an operation about 9 months ago I am currently coming to terms with a less than welcome (and certainly unexpected) imapct upon my life and mobility."
"Issues such as lack of mobility, excessive swelling and cronic pain from the ankle itself but also from the toes and lack of sensation and feeling in parts of the foot are those I am facing and would like to know how other poeple have fared, both in the short and longer term."

"I firmly believe our bodies respond to environmental changes, either for the good or for the bad (i.e. weather change-ankle pain), but also believe the proper environment (places and friends) makes a whole lot of a difference in people's behaviour, surely helping into the healing process. Good for you to go for the 10 miles, I too want to get back cycling again and I agree that doing it on stationary bike is not at all the same thing."
"To the point, I hope our example can serve well to our friends-in-pain out there, for sure we will always have limitations after such difficult surgery but we must pursue best directions to healing that fit each specific case."

"The STAR was the culmination of 9 other surgical procedures on the lower leg, so I guess everything bar the STAR itself is well worn out."
"I never classifed myself as disabled and have just discovered, finding myself needing to apply for P.I.P. that it is classed as a prosthesis and therefore qualifies as a disability. Has anyone had any success in claiming either DLA or PIP payments for their ankle replacement joint?"
"Bradley"
"I think I am the first one to respond to you in this forum. My procedure was done end of December 2014, so it is now practically 6 months since. I don't know if this is your first (foot) surgery ever, but I am kind of ""veteran"" in the field of foot surgery, four so far, and as such I am no stranger to problems such as numbness. I think this is part of the trade off, unfortunately, you can ask around here and you will find that many of us went/is going through this. Imagine, there is a network of tiny nerves in our body, cris-crossing everywhere, almost impossible to avoid them with a scalpel."
"One thing I can asure you, the TAR recovery is expected to be a slow one. I have friend who had knee and hip replacements and soon enough they are up and active, but ankle somewhat is harder. If my experience counts anything, I say just be patient because you will overcome the difficulties and the unpleasant feelings you have now. In my case I am very satisfied with the results, but I still hope to see better times ahead. The very fact that I do not have arthritis pain in my foot joint today is already a welcoming accomplishment, the rest is manageable."
"Hope this helps to elevate the spirits."
"Gilbert"
"Thanks so much for the reply. Greatful I found this forum. And I appreciate your words of encouragement. Yes this is my first surgery of its kind. I am only in my 3rd post op week so of course just waiting as patiently as possible to start attempting to walk. My surgeon expects that after 4 weeks when I see him next. I have to say psycologically I do not think I was well prepared for this. I scheduled out 2 months in advance but I think I just pushed it back in my mind during that time. I find out I am phobic with a wrapping or a cast on. Also was not at all good with the pain or the pain medication (narcotics). It was very rough in the beginning. My surgeon had an earful that first week from me. He decided to not put me in a cast because of my phobic condition for this third and fourth week and instead I got what people here refer to as the moon boot right away. Told me not to take it off and that it would help me not get that panicky feeling knowing I could take it off. But he was very clear about keeping it on. Was uncomfortable at first and I did take advantage of the straps and air pump / relief valve at times only when not moving around. Thankful my surgeon did this for me. I am through the toughest post op period I believe now pain wise as I do not take pain medication all that often. If I need some help, ibuprofen helps. No Narcotics. I realize I am improving just writing this stuff down and that helps. Glad to hear that you are doing well and wow, what you have gone through had to be challenging. I will be updating here as I go through my recovery. The surgeon says my procedure went well and after 2 weeks the X-Ray showed no problems. Said I should heal up good. But yes, understand this is the toughest of the big three joint replacements to recover from. All the Best Gilbert"
"Bradley"
"I think it is all the same for me, been there done that, feeling claustrophobic, not narco-friendly, but these are all phases we have to go through - you might still have to get used to the feeling of your friends face frowning when they hear for the first time you had an ankle replacement.... but the fun part is yet to come, next is physical therapy sessions. Little by little you will see the progress you make, just as a caution, do not expect fast results at first, so don't get frustrated too soon, but work hard and persistently, as soon as the doctor gives you the okay to do so."
"Best recovery,"

"If you scan on this thread you will see I am also a TAR ""Survivor"" and also a hip replacement ""victim"". I had my TAR 6 Oct 2014 so I am actually reporting back quickly."
"I agree that TAR is by far much harder than hip replacement surgery."
"The last three months I went to a biokentisist and he helped me a lot. I was finally ""fired"" by him end of last month as he felt he could not do anything more. I became aware of the fact that at the end I had more pain and discomfort after I went for a session so I also felt it was time to move on. The best thing I could have done was to get soles made to put in my shoes and since then I am another person after I started wearing them. Keep that in minds gents!"
"All in all..8 months down the road, I am very happy with my ankle. It is stiff when I get up in the morning and sometimes, especially like now in the winter (I live in South Africa - Bloemfontein..pretty cold in winter here..-5 C etc.) I have some discomfort after I get up in the morning but it soon disappears when I walk a bit. I do my exercises every day (5-10 minutes at most) and my life is really becoming more and more normal every day. I am extremely happy I had the procedure where the prosthesis was placed from the side of the ankle. I have had no nerve damage, no numbness or anything so far. I have a liquid build-up in my leg but my surgeon said it's normal and will disappear in time. I do find that when I walk longer distances my ankle gets tired and will then start to pain a bit, especially when I sit for a while after I have walked a long distance and then get up. I used to always drink two pain pills (Ultracet) before I go to places where I may walk for longer distances but two weeks ago we had an air race here I an spend most of the day standing and walking and did not even thought of taking something for pain. Was actually surprised afterwards when I realized I totally forgot to take something."
"It is amazing how one can see the progress every week.. yes, I had a spell where it felt as if nothing improved anymore and I was not really happy with what I had at that stage but slowly my ankle started to improve again and now it's so much better. Best of all is that I sleep like a baby with no pain at night."
"I would advise you to be patient, don't over tress your ankle too soon but start as soon as possible to move your ankle. You have a window period to get your gait as wide as possible and the sooner you can get the same movement as your other ankle, the better. I have a 100% normal gait in my left ankle now...ever better than my other ankle at this stage...all painless. I also only wore a moonboot for two weeks before I started to walk on the ankle but here you have to go with your surgeon’s advice as we have had different procedures. Just hang in there Bradley, things do improve in time."
"I am glad all seems to be going well with you also Gilbert?."
"TAR certainly is not for sissy’s and I guess one has to take it in your stride…"
"Regards"

"Thanks for your words of encouragement. I did remember reading your past post. I will take seriously your recomendation to get custom shoes/insoles and whatever else it takes in that category for sure. I was just thinking about it before I saw your post and got that idea from you from your prior post. I am sure I will start with seeing about replacing all my shoes with this. I feel that this is something that can help tremendously and also possibly extend the useful life of the ankle replacement."
"I am to minimize my ankle movement per doctors orders for a week yet and then I will see him. He will then start me off most likely with some weight bearing and exercises. But I can tell you that I test the ankle at times with a bit of up and down motion with no pain from the ankle joint area. Just everything around has some pain and numbness at times but understand that it is from the surgery. This procedure has to be a major shock to the body...the reason for the long recovery time. Thus ""Not for Sissy's"" description is perfect. For some reason it bothers me more at night. I am glad that your ankle situation has improved and continues on that path. It is important that the positive results get out for people to read. But glad also that people post their dissapointments too because we have to remain grounded in reality. There is no replacing the original ankle God gave us with something of equal function. The body is an amazing machine. Anyway thanks again Leon and continued success to you."
"Bradley"
"As usual, you serve as a model to me when it comes to the TAR recovery process, you present it quite well in your note to not over stress the area in the first two-three weeks, since all is still tender, plus we have ""fresh"" screws/pegs attached to the bones, you don't want to cause a problem there - I remember having a fall in the bathroom in my second week, boy, that scared me (and my wife too) but rushed to hospital for x-ray, all was fine. I also relate with the issues with stiffness and discomfort while doing long walks (my gait is not 100% yet) but amazingly enough I do not feel pain if I stand for a too long time! I was recently in a museum exhibition, walking slowly and standing for hours with no problems. I recall this would be no fun for me before my surgery, since pain would force me to cut it short."
"Like you, I also keep my exercise routine in the mornings, at least 15 min., achilis elongations, ankle lifting combinations. It always feels bether after that. I also go to the swimming pool sometimes and practice 'jumping' on my toes (left leg) in the water, followed by more tendon stretching on the pool wall, holding on the side of the pool. this feels really great! rewarding workout."
"As for numbness, it is my own experience after all my surgeries that some feeling is lost on the skin, in the vicinity of scars as well as other parts of the foot. This used to bother me, but today I think it is a small token to pay, considering that the alternative (living with chronic pain) is much worse."
"My struggle to healing continues, with the help from you and other TAR patients who share their experiences in this place."
"Gilbert"
"I take it that you had your TAR November 2014. Was it the STAR (from the front of the ankle) the Zimmer Trabecular Type (from the outer side of the ankle)?. I have had a lot of concern’s regarding this particular scenario you are possibly faced with. I also had a discussion with my surgeon regarding ''plan B' should the implant fail and you basically echo his words regarding possible amputation etc. It is true that the cavity left by the implant is relatively big and cannot easily be filled. I did understand from my surgeon that it is possible to do a fusion if there is enough bone, but it can leave you with a relatively shorter leg and a long recovery period. I am not sure if it's possible in all cases though. I would also seriously suggest you go for at least one other opinion before you make any decisions."

"I am a bit busy currently so not on the web too much. Please excuse me for not replying sooner."
"After my TAR last year I obviously had to take it easy for the first two weeks with no exercises. I had a boot on when I went home after 14 days in Cape Town and because I am 1000 km from my surgeon he briefed me pretty good on what to do and what not to do. I had to use ice on my foot for the next two weeks. He gave me a very nice purpose made covering that takes two frozen plastic bags (blue freezer gel in it – I got 4 – two on the ankle and two in the freezer) and it all wraps tightly around the ankle with velcro. It is extremely useful and comfortable. My surgeon basically gave me only two exercises to do. The one is to take my towel in the morning after I showered, roll it up and hook it on my front part of my foot and then pulling back on it for 50 seconds and I repeat it 10 times. Simple but very effective. It stretches the Achilles tendon and it increases the movement on the joint. I started doing that about a month post-opp. The other one is standing in front of a wall and then bend your knee trying to touch the wall ..also 10 times. At first I could not get close to the wall, even with my toes against the wall. I have been doing that exercises ever since every day and today I have my toes about 5 cm from the wall and my knee can still touch the wall, heel down on the floor all the way. I have had more intensive treatment for 3 months also but I have found that there is not much that can be done and it only made my ankle become painful.."
"Interestingly, yesterday I walked around on my office floor and after a while I realized for the first time that I had actually completely forgotten about my ankle while I was walking. No pain or any discomfort. It comes and goes and sometimes I have a bit of pain but it goes away as soon as I have walked a short distance."

"Hi Gilbert"
"Many moons ago that I have posted on this forum and I hope all my TAR friends are still hanging in there. Now, where do I begin?."
"I had a an incident with my TAR ankle about 3 years ago where the plate on my Fibula bent and actually broke a few screws. The prosthesis shifted. My home surgeon took one look and replied that the replacement is loose and needs to be taken out. I was quite upset and went for a second opinion at one of SA's leading ankle expert. He also said it has to come out, cavity to be filled with donor bone and an external fixation (Taylor spacial Frame) , must be installed. It all needed to be done 1000km from my home. Long story short, I was in Cape Town, in hospital and at six in the morning first on the theater list. With the anesthetist taking my bp, weight etc. for the doping exercise...I decided to leave it. Yes, I walked out of there and went on a week holiday with my wife before driving back to my home city. Now you would probably think I was crazy but you know, if one has to go for such a radical intervention and to be stranded with such an instrument attached to your leg for 9 months + one would at least expect that the surgeon who was responsible for the installation, would come and talk to me once?. Never happened because he was always too busy. So I decided that nobody will have the opportunity to treat me like a piece of beef and I packed my bags. Now, 3+ years along the line, having being diagnosed with Hemochromatosis for which I had DNA tested and I am a C282Y/C282Y Homocygote . That means I inherited a gene from both parents that mutated and gave me extreme Hemochromatosis (elevated blood iron levels). I have been bleeding a lot as Phlebotomy is the only way to get the hugely elevated iron levels out of my blood. I went from a Ferritin count of over 2000 to a mere 54. Slowly I regained much of my 'normal' life and I prevented any damage to my organs, except for arthritis in my joints. I also received an injection once when my non TAR ankle had inflammation and I lost all sensory ability under my left (TAR) foot. Now over two years, very weird and uncomfortable at times but live with that too. I have been popping 100 Mg Tramahexel slow release pain killers for the last 3 years..daily up to four plus anti-inflammatory pills."
"Today: My left ankle is no longer loose and I walk daily on it. Sometimes it does become a bit worn out and painful, especially when I am very active during the day. My right ankle is bone on bone and I will have to get it fused. Three weeks ago I went for a check-up at my physician and I mentioned to him that have for years heard from doctors after blood tests that I have elevated uric levels in my blood. Nobody ever gave me anything for it up until then. He gave me a prescription and now, after 3 weeks I am starting to feel so much better. I have not taken a single pain killer in over a week. I have almost no discomfort in any one of my ankles and I feel a new person."
"I have lost all faith in the medical profession because I had hell fro many years and it's only by God's grace that I have no liver/kidney damage. No one ever addressed the uric acid levels and it gave me more arthritis and worn out joints, all while is was right in front of them many times. But now I am OK and I must say, though my TAR is not perfect, it's much better that what I had and I can walk with it. One must give a TAR real time to heal ,,which perhaps did not, but I still made the right decision to walk out and keep what I had. If that removal went pear shaped, I could have lost my leg."
"Looking forward to feeling better every day also."

"Well, interesting enough I got a ""box"" and the ""sox"" right now at work! I still don't know well about the 'copper' property on swelling but I got these because they act with some restraining force which keeps the swelling from concentrating around the ankle and scar areas. I don't use ice though, but I make sure I move around from my chair as often as possible, plus I do a good deal of elongation exercises early in the morning. The only pain I feel lately (this is 6 months after my procedure) is minor, just around the instep of the ankle and it happens when I do movements forward or waking downstairs. I am quite okay with that, I should not complain much, really. All I want is to share here my progress with others who have gone through the same, and I know every case is a case."

"I agree. The trick is to have the cold part curved around the ankle joint and not just on it... I had a bit more ""advanced"" ice packs but the concept is the same."

"Having good days certainly makes us optimistic, congratulations. My procedure is three months older then yours, I too feel good about the results of TAR - my main issue was athritis pain which is gone from my life! - but I still feel the discomforts of the recovery, namely: swelling, slow walking, tendons not flexing or extending fully. I will soon re-start PT, doctor's orders since he says I have to try further to ""grind off"" those scar tissues around the area. I don't mind that at all, to tell the truth. He also told me the recovery is going as he expected, and I should be gaining more mobility in time, as I work more over it."
"I hear other patient's stories here that make my heart hurt, but I also know that every case is different, depending on every person's history of injuries, thus limitations are expected to be different as well. Therefore If my experience serves as a positive message to anyone with any past case, I am then happy to share."

"i keep my leg raised above my heart level as much as possible and if sitting, put that foot up on a chair to allow easier blood flow. I also massage the ankle daily with coconut oil which allows a really easy massage. This helps and is comforting too."
"So far, so good. I am cautiously optimistic 😊"
"I had a full right ankle replacement in May of this year so early days for me."
"But the pain has certainly gone - well the pain that was caused by having an arthritic ankle has. I still do get swelling and pain but of a different type and it's not continuous."
"But as I said it's early days for me as I've only just started rehab (due to long NHS waiting list and a few hospital delays)"
"I know personally that in my circumstances I am limited (but would have been with or without surgery) I will never be able to run again and I cannot participate in high impact activities (sport or dance) any longer but I am now even in this short space of time walking better"
"I guess it really is down to individual quirks?"
"I also during the op was given a nerve block to help me deal with the post op pain."
"Now that two days has passed my foot is in plaster and i have a intermitent stabbing pain that has been with me from the start ( even with the nerve block) and a numb big toe that has just appeaed."
"I was wondering if other had the same problem but after reading the posts i see that is common."
"Still as a new poster i will keep the fourm updated."
"Uncharacteristically, my Orthopedist put me in a boot only two weeks post Op with instructions to do range of motion exercises. Until reading your posts, I was feeling impatiently concerned as I unrealistically expected immediate full mobility (especially with the Achilles lengthening procedure). My incision is healing well. Numbness has mostly subsided, but I have twinges of burning alongside the medial part of foot. Movement of the joint itself is very limited. I try to balance pain with range of motion exercises (with an elastic resistance band) to begin regaining flexibility. Most of the day, I sit with my foot elevated. When I have to lower my leg, I find that flexing my foot (like 10 times) stimulates enough circulation to keep that pressure pain to a minimum. Soreness and achiness occur at the end of days."
"I’m excited to start PT at six weeks to deal with these muscles, tendons, and ligaments that did not work properly for 42 years. Your comments about this being a painful process are encouraging and help me accept that the recovery will be slow. I especially appreciated the comment that “if you work hard, you should end up with a good result.”"
"I am now 2 months post TAR surgery and have completed 5 PT sessions. I can now control my pain and swelling levels (except during PT sessions) depending on how much I move and bear weight. I am satisfied (not ecstatic) with increased mobility after 42 years of an ankle locked in plantar flexion, but am behind schedule in my ability to bear weight (currently at about 30 pounds tolerance)."
"Anybody at my stage, I suggest finding a Great PT and a pool where you can walk in chest deep water."
"Very similar to others here I am 51 and had a major accident on my right ankle over 30 years ago (broke both 'ankle bones' off with a number of corresponding fractures moving up into my leg. After an excellent recovery I never thought about it much more; it always looked a little deformed and ached in bad weather but other than that, nothing. Nearly three years ago I started with chronic sciatica on my left side, and ended up with an emergency L%S1 discectomy. Since then my back has continued to deteriorate and I have very bad bursitis in my left hip. Then chronic pains started in my right ankle and my excellent physic made me go for an x-ray which showed that I had end stage osteo-arthritis of the whole joint (which had caused and will continue to cause all the problems in my spine and left hip). The only obvious options were fusion or a TAR and I was keen to put a lot of effort in, so knowing that it might not work & had a relatively limited life expectancy I entered the TARVA (total ankle replacement vs anthrodesis) NHS trial. Working with my physio and using the NHS’s ‘choose and book (which i didm;t know existed !) I went with a specialist ankle surgeon who was luckily also close to my home."
"I had my TAR 48 hours ago - a ‘successful’ op by my surgeon’s accounts but difficult; my actual ankle was small and quite deformed when they went in and they broke the medial maleolus in the process and have had to plate that too. When testing the amount of movement I would be likely to get they took the decision that it was still being very limited by shortened muscles / achilles tendon which had happened because of my limited movement over time so they have gone in there too and cut that in a way which will hopfully help it stretch. So it’s quite a bit more surgery and sounding more complicated with a longer recovery period than I had hoped for, but absolutely nothing that he hadn’t discussed with me in advance. He also knew that I have pre booked long term physio (with somebody he knows well) which starts next week (now just to keep the rest of me mobile as it will be too early to touch my ankle)."
"The reason I was doing some slightly different internet searches this morning is that I could not believe the pain I have been in throughout the night and was getting increasingly worried about the fact my toes are slowly going ‘dead’. I have pain throughout and a burning sensation down the front of my shin- maybe I was just being overly optimistic - does this sound familiar to others here ?"
"Also, I am interested in what pain relief people left hospital with- I had a great anaesthetist who told me I would need heavy duty painkillers to get through the first few weeks (she was in persuasion mode as I don’t like to take too many) and I agreed to it. But on the ward they have written me up with paracetemol, ibuprofen 3 times a day and 2.5ml of oxycodone ?"
"Any answers would be very welcome - and I am sure I will be back on in coming weeks with lots more ! It’s very helpful to see people’s journey of progression."
"Sometime since I have posted on my surgery."
"I have had a busy year and I have had the best of movement in my TAR ankle possible. Lately I have had some pain and discomfort and went to the surgeon on Tuesday. It appears that my Fibula never healed and my whole ankle has moved, braking a screw and the others are comming loose. So far the possiblilty exists that the prostheses has become loose as well and I need to go for a CT scan to find out what the condition of the prosthesis is. I am back on crouches to save my ankle any other stress in case the prostehsis is still inact. If it is loose, then I am in for one hell of an operation and an attempt to permanently fix my ankle with NO movement what so ever. Bad news my friends."
"I will keep posting here but at this stage I am of the opnion that TAR may unfortuanatly be a short term solution to a long term problem...meaning...think again before you go for it. It works very well but is can not last for very long, unless you sit most of the time and keep weight and stress away from you ankle most of the time."
"Regards"
"Leon"
"Like you, long time I do not post here, but knowing that is your posting I cannot fail to reply. I am so sorry for your current situation, I knew you were a difficult case because of your fibula plus all the screws, I regret to hear the news of more intervention surgery on you my friend."
"My TAR is now approaching one full year by the end of December. Perhaps I am lucky, but I still believe each TAR case is a particular case, but also believe the recovery burden will be different for each patient. I did three sections of PT this year, by the third one I realized that I have reached the ""final threshold"", I mean, today I know my recovery is over and my mobility gain is no more, I am stuck with it for ever. It is not too bad, I can walk freely without any mechanical help, only my tendons became stiffer than before and I have little pain and dragging when I walk. I still maintain a routine exercise, which I know it does good to my mobility. I cannot run or stomp my left foot and walking on uneven ground is a challenge, or simply walking down a staircase."
"I am 60 y.o. now and I don't know how long more I have to live. All I expect is that my TAR will endure with me for the rest of it anyway, again, I think I am one of the lucky ones that can say with much confidence that the procedure worked for me."
"Wishing all the best to you in the upcoming procedure, with a positive result nonetheless."
"Gilbert"
"I am glad all is well with your TAR so far."
"I had x-rays taken in March this year and the surgeon said all is fine, except for the Fibula that was taking it's time to heal. I regret not going for x-rays again in October but I was going on very well although I had minor discomfort when got after sitting for a while. For me that was ok and nothing out of the ordinary. Even now I am walking without any serious pain and I am holding on to the slight possibility that perhaps the prosthesis is still in place and well fixated and that it's only the Fibula failure that causes the problems. Maybe it can be strengthened with a bigger plate and the prosthesis re-aligned. I also have 100% smooth movement in the joint without any significant pain. I hope to have a CT scan taken his week and that will establish the status of the prosthesis and from there a course of action will have to be decided upon."
"The prognosis for TAR failure is not good and the options very grim. Total fusion if no infection or amputation. Revision is a possibility although I don’t think is a solution. So far I don't have infection but with a possible loosening prosthesis… rejection may creep in and with it infection. I hope I am spared of that fate though."
"I am in good spirits and I have been once without a hip for 8 months and lots of uncertainty and it all worked out at the end."
"Best advice I can give at this stage is to look extremely well after your ankle and do less than more with it, even if it feels 100%. The wear and tear on that little piece of metal is enormous and one can really misjudge the capabilities of the replacement and end up with loosening. I am 53 so I hope to have a few years left."

"I would like to estabish contact with anyone who has undergone ankle replacement surgery and reflect a ittle on the aftereffects and the longer term prognoses for recovery and mobility."
"Having undergone such an operation about 9 months ago I am currently coming to terms with a less than welcome (and certainly unexpected) imapct upon my life and mobility."
"Issues such as lack of mobility, excessive swelling and cronic pain from the ankle itself but also from the toes and lack of sensation and feeling in parts of the foot are those I am facing and would like to know how other poeple have fared, both in the short and longer term."

"It is always great to hear news of success with ankle replacement, and it appears yours is becoming one success! Having good doctors backing you up is also a blessing (I am in Houston, also good doctor with me). I am surprised to hear you are already walking - if I understood correctly without any mechanical help - and having almost no pain and swelling, not even two months after tbe procedure, that is quite amazing!"
"I wish the best on your continuing recovery, your experience will be very important to the participants of this forum. I just want to remind though the advice from Mr. Leon above, in his last paragraph where he recommends caution even when we feel ""100%"" ok. I always believed that every TAR case is a case, and I read different stories here that proves exactly my point."
"All the best,"

"I was in the hospital just over night. I took pain pills for about two days because the dr insisted this would be necessary, so my family insisted I take them. I was in the surgercial dressing for 3 weeks. They need remove dressing and put on a cast fr two weeks. i just went this past Thursday for another cast and was advise to use a walker or crutches but I need to start taken about 5 steps an hour and work my way up to 10steps. so on Friday, i was a little nervous butI got up and put my foot on the floor. Honestly I can walk around the house without walker or crutches. I don't have pain just a little discomfort. My family says I am doing to much. I plan on calling the doctor tomorrow and see if I am pushing things and should I take it easy. I walked in pain since my accident back in 2002. I know with still having a cast this maybe the reason it doesn't hurt. does this sound right"
"Regards, G."
"Despite of everything I consider myself quite lucky today because I can walk and do most normal activities, except for running or having any hard impact on my ankle. My tendon is still stiff, but I exercise everyday to keep some flexibility at least."
"All the best,"
"I have taken a look at the inbone type of TAR you had it seems like very well designed system. It also seems that Tornier is now the owners of the Wright company. I will keep the Wright inbone and Infinity type implant as a possibility or probably as a last resort for my failing TAR, however I am not sure if it is available in South Africa. Having to seriously look at the alternatives after I found out my TAR is failing, I am forced to weigh all the possibilities and to be honest, they paint a grim picture…completely fixed foot or amputation. One thing one must realize about your implant is that it has a huge effect on your bones and there is not much to be done if something goes wrong with that prosthesis and it has to be removed, on the other hand, I like the stem in the bone on both sides. The sponge type tantalum metal let’s the bone penetrate the metal and completely “grows” to be part of your body. Much the same as my hip replacement."
"I sincerely hope your implant lasts all the way. If one looks at the fact that one’s ankle's actually have an enormous amount of concentrated weight on them, one must be very careful not to over tress them. I have also had swelling during the day and after a good night sleep it all was gone. I am not saying it's a sign of trouble though, but just be very careful of not damaging your replacement by being too active on it too soon. I am a living example of a person who had no hip and it was replaced 8 months after it was destroyed in an accident and the doctor who replaced it did an excellent job, but instead of having me walk on the hip too soon, he opted to restrain the movement of the hip to only 30 degrees with a body suit and I had to keep it on for 6 weeks and stayed off the foot all the time. It was hard and frustrating but now, 8 years later that hip is still 100% and I can use it normally. I am saying this to demonstrate the value of looking after a replaced joint the right way. As far as my ankle is concerned, I am up and about but I am walking on a time bomb and in retrospect, I could have taken better care of the TAR and I could have rather kept it protected for one day more instead of perhaps one day to few. TAR is not to be compared to hip or knee replacement ever. It’s way more complicated and the forces at play are really very strong. Never think it is 'ok' if you have pain in it and believe me, nothing lasts forever unless you make it last. One tend to become oblivious to the fact that there is a bit more pain on a day-to-day basis and you ignore it because you are busy and you write it off as just small discomfort that will go away. Listen very carefully to your body. I am 1000 km away from my surgeon and it complicated things enormously for me I ignored the little spike here and there in my ankle, I ignored it being more stiff in the morning than a few before etc., but don’t take any abnormality lightly. Just a few wise words from a person who owns the TAR T-shirt, the hip replacement one and is busy (reluctantly) putting on the failing TAR T-shirt, amongst many others."

"Glad to make your acquaintance Scott. Makes me feel a lot better knowing I am not alone."
"I had the Zimmer Trabecular implant with the plate/screws on the Fibula. I also had a CT scan and it is clear looking at the ""dark"" lines around the prosthesis that there is loosening. I am amazed that your CT scan can’t determine the status of the prosthesis as that is supposed to be the ultimate method of determining the status"
"I also had great movement (still have) and at times it all felt 100% normal and at times I had a bit of pain and discomfort. It went so well that my physiotherapist said they can’t do anything more because of the great movement, painlessness etc. Slowly I started limping more and more and eventually I realized that there must be something wrong. My left leg shrunk with 1 cm (hence the increased limping) and then when we took X-rays the damage became evident."
"In my case the Fibula never really healed and eventually it collapsed. I am not sure what happened first, the collapse or the screw that broke in half. So far I am still able to ""walk"" wearing a Moon Boot. No doubt here about the status of the prosthesis and it is definitely loose. What is in interesting is the fact that the prosthesis subsided and tilted. It really makes me wonder about the long term prospects of any TAR due to the amount of weight placed on the small prosthesis. I am not sure if the bone behind the prosthesis can endure and absorb the pressure put on it by the metal prosthesis. Maybe the Infinity in bone TAR is an exception as it will spread the pressure with the pin inside the bone. One tends to forget about what is going on in your ankle when you walk normally and in most cases the very reason fora TAR, is directly related to bone decay etc. because of the forces at play. That's how I see it. For all practical reasons, I am in deep trouble and I am not sure what can be done. I am obtaining a few opinions from surgeons. One thing is for sure and that is the fact that no matter what will be done, it is not going to be an easy operation, no guarantees offered and a lengthy recovery period to follow plus possibly a shorter (3.2cm) leg. Looking at your age you probably are same as me, an active member of the work force. The prospects of not being at work for up to 6-8 weeks is not what I anticipated at all. I also have a shoulder that is bone-on-bone and my other ankle is also in an advanced state of osteo arthrosis so walking on that ankle with crouches will also put tremendous pressure on those two joints. I guess I will have to take them one-by-one."
"I really hope in your case they can get the cement in and promote bone growth thereby saving the prosthesis. I think one should also consider the effect of the cement in (the hopefully unlikely) case the tibial component need's to be removed at a later stage?. Speaking from experience, I would suggest you stay off the ankle right away as walking on it for the next ten days may only aggravate the loosening of the prosthesis, if it has indeed started to become loose."
"I have an appointment next week with one of the very best surgeons in the field of reconstructive ankle surgery. I will post his findings and I will definitely consider what he can offer me and probably go for it. He is not in my city and although I am going for a consultation only, it may be the case that he want’s to operate right away, in which case I may be out of contention for a while, but I will report back."
"Look well after that ankle Scott, it's worth it."
"Leon"
"I am not from the US unfortunately (South Africa) but that is an issue that can be overcome. I am really glad you gave me this information now because I am seeing a surgeon next week and I also want to bounce this option off from him. Maybe I can get such a device for my other ankle and stretch his lifespan a bit longer."
"Seeing that you went to Washington for the devise, can you give me just a rough estimate of the cost involved?. We are struggling with an ever weakening ZAR /US$ exchange rate but at least to have an idea will give me the opportunity to make a few calculation’s. I was actually supposed to be in Seattle on 4 March for a conference but I was not sure if I can make it with the condition my ankle is in. If I knew this earlier, I could have made sure to be there and afterwards went for the devise."
"Regards"
"Leon"
"Thank you for the information."
"$9k is expensive in any denomination but that can be overcome. I have good medical cover and I will talk to them at some stage. I have noticed the Facebook page but I personally do not have any connections with Facebook, though I am an IT professional. Just a matter of principal."
"I have already contacted the Hanger Clinic and they have also replied. For now I want to get all the information I need and discuss it with the surgeon I am visiting next week. For me it's much about saving my other ankle plus whatever can be done for my current failed TAR ankle. From what I have seen, I am extremely impressed and I feel this is a definite option for me. I have friends in Vancouver ...not sure it it's a bit too far out of the way though. How long did you stay at the clinic?. That will obviously also contribute to costs for me."
"At least I have another option if nothing else comes to light. I really appreciate the fact that you mentioned this device to me. I will definitely let you know what comments I get from the surgeon next week. Should be interesting to see what he says."
"Leon"
"Thanks for the information, must be pretty late at night in the US by now?. Very sunny and hot 32C day here."
"This is very helpful and if I do go for this option, then I will certainly have to stay in either the US or Canada (Vancouver) for the 2 week period in-between visits and then fly back to SA. I will work thru all this when I am back next week and who knows, could very well be that the surgeon himself wants to check it out etc. Pity it's not available locally but in time it should become available here also, probably only in a few year's time. An Exosym/IDEO device for both legs will be the ultimate but it will also be a financial nightmare. I do have the same problem in both ankles so it makes sense to go for both."
"In all the time I have had the TAR, I have never had any different sensation in any part of my foot. I had a bit of swelling in the beginning after the operation and had to put a lot of ice on it. That went away after about 2 months. Later I had a build-up of water in my left leg which gave me a very “heavy” feeling when I walked. It was noticeable with a ring pressed into my leg by my socks. It literally felt like I had two bricks tied to each foot when I got home from work. Was gone in the morning after I slept and elevated my leg for a few hours. I later found out it had something to do with a high blood pressure pill I was drinking. I seldom have that sensation now, obviously not taking that particular pill anymore. I currently walk with the boot and it’s becoming easier by the day. Very little pain and discomfort at this stage when I walk with the boot. I still have 90+% gate, also mostly painless. Kind of weird to think it’s actually loose while it feels not that bad. I can also walk barefoot, usually more pain after I sat for a while but when it’s “warmed up” I walk rather effortless. Maybe you have either a nerve that is being pressed upon by a bone or another object or it could be new nerves growing. They can grow for around 18 months and that gives off a tinkling sensation. I had some “dead” sensation on the back of my left hand after being in an auto accident in 2007. Later the feeling came back but it had a ""tingling “ sensation for a while then. Gone now."

"Anyway, I just wanted to say its interesting to see how you are all coping with your symptoms/surgery. Wishing you all a fit healthy and happy recovery."
"Ive been reading your blog in full, and followed your progress right up to your operation at the Royal Orthopaedic, surgeon was Mr.Goldberg I believe. Im dismayed to hear of your subsequent pain as I thought you had it nailed and did not have all the after problems most people had. Im at the point of considering this operation on my left ankle and have also been threading with Barb. I even am trying to get a referral to the royal orthopaedic based on your experience thinking that it was down to the surgeon that performed it as I know it has to be very very accurate. So now Im confused. Im 68 yrs old pretty active with young grand children that I look after part time and cannot envisage months of pain and disability following this operation, but dont know what the alternative is. Im not in pain as such at the moment but know it will get worse so my dilemma is wait or do it while joints are still relatively healthy. Would love your thoughts on the whole process so far."
"i was up and on crutches immediately and, after 2-3 weeks, was walking without them. All seems perfectly good now with some stiffness upon waking and numbness in the top area of the foot and big toe,"

"Still think it was a good idea to go for a TAR and feel sure that the pain and swelling is less painful than the pre op state."
"All plates screws and hard wear were removed and now I am left with 2 screws holding the fusion in place and a rod holding my tibula in place."
"I honestly can say, I wish they had of amputed my broken tibula and crushed ankle leg at the time of the 1st surgery. I have not returned back to work, the fused ankle leg is shorter than the other leg which I broke the femur. I am in constant pain, even tho the xrays back in Jan were looking great. I am still taking high dose addictive pain meds every few days depending on my activity level. I have no movement in my ankle and have been wearing a walking boot cast since October."
"Any suggestions or support would be kindly welcomed."
"Going in for operation number 8 tomorrow."
"Two keyhole surgeries"
"2 TAR surgeries"
"3 so called corrective surgeries."
"Tomorrow is an ankle fusion. Removing the TAR and filling the gap with a ports metal. One massive long screw going from my heel upwards, plus brackets and screws to keep it in place. Sure they said a bone graft from my hip too."
"He did say that if this doesn't work we could try once more before thinking of amputation."
"This has been ongoing for 10 years, I've taken so much medication that I've got an ulcer."
"But the one good thing is that a lady from the UK will see me after the operation to see if I'm a candidate for an idea brace. So I will keep my fingers crossed because I can't take this any longer. It has not only ruined my life and health but my relationship with my girlfriend of 15 years."
"Maybe one day I will wake up, that's if I sleep properly and be pain free."
"I hope all went well?. I am in the same boat as you so lots of understanding and sympathy. I was at a surgeon a week ago and this is what they say they can do for me."
"Take out the prosthesis and fill the cavity with donor bone. Then take half of my fibula, grind it down and build two ""pillars"" on the sides, also a chance of taking extra bone from the hip, if needed. Then my ankle is fixated in an O-ring type fixator with pins into the bone for up to 5 months, of which the first 6 weeks will be non-weight bearing (I decided at least 3 months instead of 6 weeks…very important to not spoil the growth) and hopefully the bone will fuse well. In time my body will absorb the donor bone and replace with own bone. The nice thing is that there are no pins and brackets, screws etc. involved. My leg will only be about 2 cm shorter that the other. The bad thing is...going to take a lot time and living with an ankle bracelet that is not very comfortable. Also huge risk of infection that needs to be managed very well. Looking at the grim possibilities when a TAR folds, I am cautiously optimistic. This particular surgeon has done 6 similar operations and all were successful., oldest patient 72 years of age."
"Please let me know how you are progressing Peter."

"I had the Zimmer Tribucular implant done about 18 months ago. As I have mentioned somewhere on this thread, it has become loose. Looking back and thinking what I could have done better, the one thing that stands out is the fact that I should have stayed off my ankle for at least 8-10 weeks. Secondly would be to have had an inner sole ready to wear in the Moon Boot rightnfrom the start. I waited 6 weeks for mine and the boot was just too uncomfortable to cope with for a full working day. That forced me walk without a boot and opssibly contributed to my loose prosthesis. Another interesting fact is that smoking has a huge adverse effect on the healing process of bones. I don't smoke but it's worth taking notice of."
"My ankle is ok, no pain and I have been up and about working with heavy metal..welding etc. and it's fine. Sometimes I can't believe it's loose inside.... 100% painless movement the works."
"All the best."
"I was a healthy athletic paddle boarder, jogger, hiker until I was in a severe motorcycle accident in July of 2014 in which I broke my neck, crushed my right lower leg loosing 4"" of tibia and fibia bones, crushed my left foot and ankle and lost skin on all side of my body. It's now 2016 and 41 surgeries (motorcycle accident related) later. They spoke of removing my right leg and left foot, however by the grace of God the trauma doctors did what they could to save them. I am not fully walking yet, my skin has active hypertrophic scarring and my neck is fabulous. My latest two surgeries were a left foot fusion followed by a left TAR mid Dec. 2015. All went well. I was non weight bearing for approx. 2 months. I increased weight slowly 30lbs at a time till I was at full weight. I walked without much pain at all for a few days, then the outer side of my foot and heal be gain to hurt. The more I walked the more I hurt until I couldn't walk on it any longer. I went in for X-rays a week later. He saw nothing but suspected a heal fracture, saying you've been immobile for 1 1/2+ years and your bones have lost strength. He put me back in a cast for a month, non weight bearing. So I see him in 2 weeks for cast removal and an X-ray to confirm fracture, or decide if not a fracture what to do. It's hard to have such hope of carefully walking with reduced pain to back in a cast, elevating. However I have great hope to walk again, and swim, paddle, gently trail walk and live a somewhat active life."
"I went under the knife in Chicago area on Jan. 26th 2016 for an ankle replacement. I had no cartilage left in my ankle and had been dealing with agonizing pain for the last 7 years or so. I had to go down to a couple days at work and on my feet the whole shift."
"First 2 weeks in a splint with no weight bearing allowed then had the stitches removed and put into a cast for 4 weeks. X-rays taken at that time showed favorable results and no shifting of the implant. No real pain to speak of after the first week so I took myself off most pain medication except for Aleeve. I had more pain caused by the cast than the surgery and demanded that the cast be removed 4 days early due to all the issues I had with it."
"They removed the cast, took more x-rays and placed me into a walking boot for 4 weeks. Swelling is minimal and pain is very low or non-existent under normal conditions. Some tingling pulsations around the ankle which I was told are just the nerves waking up and recovering. As expected, the pain increased some once physical therapy started a week later. My therapist is very positive for a full recovery and stated that I was recovering better than most people that have gone through the replacement procedure. I will pop back on the forum and give updates periodically to inform everyone on how recovery is progressing. Even if I have mild issues it will still be better than the agony I was in before surgery. It is so awesome to put my foot on the floor in the morning and not feel pain. After reading some of the stories here I feel truly blessed and lucky so far."
"On a side note I look forward to my next doctors visit, his physician assistant is quite a hotty and I enjoy flirting with her."
"Hi"
"I had a wright in bone TAR on Feb 16, 2017. It's been three months and am happy to say that I golfed 4 times last week. I ride in a cart but I am on my feet for most of the four hours it takes to play a round. The doc says the surgery was successful. I broke my left ankle when I was 16. At age 50 I noticed some stiffness in the ankle. Mind you I was a sports junkie until then and in fact I was running and playing full court basketball with the young bucks. That was the last time I played as my ankle was totally arthritic. I dealt with it for the last 15 years until I finally decided to do the TAR. One night in the hospital and in a cast for 10 days and then into the boot. As the operation was on my left foot I was able to drive and go back to work after 3 weeks. I was able to walk after about 6 weeks. My biggest issues are numbness and swelling. My foot is numb from the top of the foot running to my big toes and down the right side of the foot and under the foot to the ball of my foot. It feels like there is a big plate in there. I don't have pain but the numb feeling is a drag. I have to be careful when I walk barefoot because I can't feel the bottom of my foot. Here's my question: have any of you experienced the numbness? And did you get back some or all of the feeling in your foot. My doc says just give it time and it should come back. I am 65 and live in Oregon."
"Hi John,"
"My surgery was eleven months ago. I was also a sports junkie. I am a 'young' 59 year old. I can't walk on the floor barefoot or do my 3 mile daily run. But I am doing everything else. I also have that annoying plate feeling in the left foot. My right foot had a big toe joint put in it 9 years ago: So my right foot also has that plate feeling. The numbness is present in my left foot, along the bottom and top. It may probably be slight nerve damage or maybe tbe veins and nerves are still all reconnecting. I wasn't supposed to run on that first surgery nine years ago: But, I did. Then my left ankle, seriously, all of a sudden got pain and swelled up and it seemed that arthritis set in overnight!"
"Thus, after two years of that, I had triple ankle arthrodesis(fusion)and ligament surgery repair. Best of luck to you!"
"Had my TAR on Feb 27th - My heel is still numb, but they also did a subtalar fuson and put in a BIG screw. After 25 years of pain, best thing I ever did. The Doc said numbnesss and swelling will decrease with time. Are you still doing any rehab? - they have me going twice a week. I'm 65 and live in MN."
"I was allowed to put about 25% weight on foot after about 3 weeks post surgery. I was in the boot and using crutches. I gradually started walking with just one crutch and no crutches after 6 weeks. I can go up and down stairs now but using a hand rail is beneficial. It's challenging going up and down stairs while on the crutches. Fortunately I only have a couple of small steps at my house so it wasnt a big deal."
"I would recommend the Wright InBone TAR. The device is very stable and xrays are all very positive at the 3 month mark. I had to have a bunch of arthritis scraped away and the doc had to move the nerve out of the way. Consequently the numbness and swelling. The good news is I can walk. I am doing physical therapy three times a week. Twice with the PT and once in the pool in addition to my playing golf. Just hoping for the feeling to come back."
"I wish you good luck in making your decision."
"Doing PT 3 times a week. I do pool therapy on my own and meet with the PT twice where he has me do agility and strengthening as well as manual manipulation to help get more range of motion. I have also been doing massage therapy and accucpuncture. No sure the accupuncture helped but I like the deep tissude scar release therapy provided by my massage therapy."
"Hope you continue to improve."
"Just got back from PT - One more and thats it. They said there is not a lot more to do and learn. The massage theropy sounds interesting - Hummmmm, wonder if i can get my wife to do it? I have a Integra Cadence TAR and so far its been great, even bought some stock in the company. Stay in touch and we can compare our progress."
"Hey Petemon,"
"Played golf again today and had to walk more because the fairways were so wet. I had no problem walking and actually feel like my swing and balance is getting better. Even though I have numbness, if I can just forget about my foot and take a full swing I have better results. I am encouraged. I go to physical therapy again tomorrow. He does foot manipulation and has me go through a little circuit. The circuit includes assisted squats on a machine, toe raises, stepping up and down on a step stool and then stepping sideways up and over to the other side and back. Then I try to balance just on my new foot (can't do this very well) for 10 seconds. Then I stand on a styrofoam foot piece and shift my weight to the outsdie of the foot and then to the inside of the foot. Finally I do range of motion on a round board that sits on the floor. I flex up and down, left and right, and then around the circular board. I do (3) rounds of this after I warm up on the stationary bike for about 7 minutes. This routine seems to get my ankle going. In additon to this I'm doing pool therapy and walking backwards on a treadmill. Hope your day is going well and yes let's keep in touch."

"I am about the same age as you. My TAR of 18 months ago is also loose and I am waiting to also have it removed and a Taylor Spatial Frame will be fitted to my leg/ankle for nobody knows how long, deffinately more than 6 weeks, closer to 5-6 months. The replacement will be removed and replaced with donor bone plus a bone graft from my Fibula to fuse the ankle joint. Leg will be shorter as well but at least no metal parts what so ever, which is a good thing I feel."
"Just to let you know, there are others in the same boat as you so stick it out. It's a long road, I know all too well but it's not impossible. Just don't step on that ankle too soon, you can make everything undone in a second, especially after the fusion. I am going to wear a Moon boot for at least another 3 months after they remove the TSP, just to make sure everything is fine, irrespective of what my surgeon suggests."
"Regards"
"I don't know how I stumbled across this site but I am so glad I did. I had my TAR almost a year ago March 18 2015. Like many others that put up remarks I have very bad pain still and it's hard to walk. Stairs are totally out of the question and just doing the little things in life I still can't do . I am 50 and had hoped for better than being disabled. My ankle swells up and I go to PT still twice a week and do home PT 3 days a week. I had very bad nerve"
"damage and very little feeling in my foot as well. I guess as I say it is what it is and I must now live this way."
"Having this kind of issue's with TAR almost a year down the road does not sound right to me. I am at 17 months since my TAR, it is totally loose now and I need a huge operation and months in a Taylor Spatial Frame to salvage my ankle. Even at this advanced stage, I can walk short distances relatively painless and I climb three storeys to office every weekday with a moon boot on, no pain."
"You have to find the cause of the pain, it is important as it can be a sign of inflamation or even rejection/loosening/migration of the prosthesis."
"All the best"
"I have not signed on for months, but another friend was in an suto accident a week ago and has already had several surgeries on his ankle, and is expected to have more. Tonight I found your message, my heart goes out to you, You are younger than my daughter, I want you to know I am praying for you, I had spinal fusion that was unsuccessful years ago, I think suffering gives us compassion for another."
"Some time since I have had contact with you. Just a quick word or two."
"I am waiting for the removal of my TAR now, should be somewhere end of April. If all goes well I will be without any metal objects in my ankle. I will have a fused ankle but not a completely stiff one, only the affected joint will be fused. Bad part is that I will have to “wear” a Taylor Spatial Frame for a few months… 5 at most…I hope. Not going to be easy but should all be worth it, I believe."
"An interesting thing has happened to me and I was wondering if it had something to do with my ankle problems, or rather the decay of the cartilage in my ankles. I had my blood tested and tested positive for Hemochromatosis after they found excessive high levels of iron in my blood. One of the symptoms of iron overload is Osteoarthritis…apart from other very grim complications. I am trying to establish if the iron in my blood actually caused the arthritis’s in my joints. If so, if anyone has the same symptoms of chronic joint inflammation and degeneration of the ankle cartilage etc., you should consider testing for high iron levels in your blood. I know there are many reasons for arthritis, but this is actually one you can be tested for."

"My story is well documneted on this thread somehwere. I have a Zimmer Tribucular Prothesis in my left ankle. It is loose and needs to be removed. No recall that I know of though....just dissapointment and regrets."
"March 2013 - Physio advised that he did not feel he could do much more for me and I was to return to him only if I felt it was required. I decided to see a Podiatrist who had just opened her practice. Very thorough in her approach and seemed to do more for me than the Physio."
"August 2013 - Referred to a local sports med doctor for review of ankle stiffness returned to the ankle along with heat in ankle and bouts of swelling and general discomfort. Referred back to Surgeon who advised that arthroscopic synovectomy may be required."
"September 2013 - Left ankle, arthroscopic synovectomy took place. Greatly improved walking and stiffness, had occasions of a severe cramp like pain up leg that stopped me from moving until it passed – this eventually subsided."
"​December 2013 / January 2014 - Bouts of swelling and some aching again. Extended periods of walking or standing on feet distressing. Limping again. Sitting or laying down also a problem due to worsening bursitis in hip."
"May 2014 – Still bouts of limping due to discomfort in ankle. Then experienced more pronounced weakness in hips and pain down right outside thigh again. Worse at night and getting to feet after periods of sitting. Both hips affected but worse in right, tender spots in both sides top of thighs and buttocks. Given exercises and stretching by physio to try and ease pain which is worsened by limping or favouring left ankle."
"August 2014 - Ankle becoming tight again, some periods of swelling. Continue with physio and clinical pilates classes to improve core strength and balance. Have continued with exercising in heated pool."
"Both Physiotherapist and Podiatrist believe that the lateral incision scar should be reviewed as it appears there is some adhering to the bone which may be the cause of some bouts of small blistering and also tenderness and aching in the region. Experience some ‘nerve ‘pain in the lower end of the lateral incision scar if placed against sheets at night, crawling sensation happens regularly and feelings of the wound being open. This often disrupts sleep. No action was ever taken on this."
"Bouts of burning pain over the medial malleolus does occur, no particular pattern to this, often looks blue and slightliy raised. Regular to almost constant tightness experienced in ankle is best described as if an elastic band has been placed around ankle region – nobody can give any explanation for this other than it is probably due to the seriousness of the original injury and subsequent surgeries. Sections of foot is still numb or pins and needles through to toes."
"September 2014 – Bursitis in right hip (minor in left) caused distressing amounts of pain requiring analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs particularly at night can also be severe into groin on right side and radiating down thigh to knee. Experienced distress if too much walking took place."
"Avoid stairs where possible as going up is a problem cannot put pressure on right side and left ankle foot weak. Going down stairs is done sideways as loss of range of motion in left ankle makes me unsteady and fear factor. Uneven ground also distressing."
"Ankle aching being experienced again and found at times coming down stairs left foot tender to step onto with weight."
"MRI took place October 2014 which indicated mild strain distal myotendinous junction soleus with adjacent oedema in Kagers fat pad. Signal increase in the distal Achilles tendon suggesting some distal Achilles tendinosis."
"Podiatrist fitted orthotics on October 2014. This has improved walking but slow and tire easily – frustrating."
"Next Podiatrist visit – heat in ankle evident along with some swelling. Do not do recommended exercise till further notice. Continue with physio, pilates, pool."
"​It is now May 2016, I have chronic pain, some days mild other times distressing. Weather can cause different reactions to the ankle area. Medical believe it is nerve pain along with some achilles tightness. Have to wear shoes with slight heal, nothing fashionable. Often wear an elastic bandage. I have been told my only other option is total fusion which could cause greater problems. I count myself lucky to still be on two feet. Weight is a problem for me which does not help the ankle but other than swimming I cannot walk distances."
"​Hope this helps."

"Quick update here, not much though."
"I am scheduled on 20 July to have my loose ankle prosthesis removed and to have a fusion, hopefully of only the one joint. Big operation waiting with a donor bone implant and a Tailor Spatial frame on my leg for at least 5 months. No metal in the ankle, which is a plus. In the mean time I have been in the boot most of the time and it has gotten so part of me I start to feel weird without it. Having a loose prosthesis is not a lot of fun, that I can tell you."
"An interesting fact I have become aware of is that I have ""HH"" or Hemochromatosis which is when your body accumulates iron. The side effects is not very encouraging so I have to get rid of a lot of blood also. As Arthritis is part of the HH symptoms I have realised that it must also be the cause of my cartilage deterioration. It is also not fun letting a pint of blood every second week but all for a better health I suppose."
"I hope all is still fine with you?."

"Following my my surgery the doctor called my sister and left a voicemail that I was his ""miracle patient"". I had so much wrong with my foot from compensating for the pain and lack of ankle joint that they had slotted me for a 4hour surgery...cutting my foot in half and using many plates and screws to fuse everything. None of that was necessary. Once they did the ankle joint replacement everything corrected itself right then and there. I am five Meeks post op and have been off the pain medicine since week two. I leave the cast/boot off when I am sitting and I constantly flex my foot. I have no pain whatsoever. I am currently walking with crutches and putting 50% of my body weight on the foot with no pain. I see the doctor in 2 weeks for my six week post op follow up. I can't imagine having anything wrong but will post if I do."
"Im sorry for all who have posted on here about their pain. We all did this is hopes of living pain free. I will pray for all of you and Gods mercy to heal you."
"Good to read your story and I still believe in TAR, although I am due to have mine removed on 20 July. Having been there, all I can say is that if I can have it all over again, I will NOT put ANY strain on that prosthesis for at least 3 months. Make sure it's 100% fixated. My surgeon also told me I can put 50 % on it etc. ...all went fine and then the pain came back...and the replacement became loose...now that is hell you are looking at when it happens."
"All the best."
"Hi Mary4013"
"I have had the Zimmer Tribucular Implant from the side, now about 20 months ago. I was scheduled on 20 July 2016 to have it removed as it's supposed to be loose, but at the last minute decided to not have the operation as it will serioulsy take away the little mobility I have. I don't want to sound negative as all TAR's are unique in their own way but for me, the Zimmer thing did not work. If you go for it, please make sure the Fibula is 100% joined and healed before you put stain on your ankle. Give your ankle at least 6 weeks of no weight bearing. It feels weird and you tend to think you have to get the joint loose and the swelling gone as soon as possible. Remember, you have your whole lifetime to do the excersizes and get the joint all loosened up. Don't make the mistake I think I made by not letting everything heal 100% before putting weight on it. The cut in my Fibula did not heal completely and it made the joint, together with the prosthesis collapse to the inside, shifting the prothesis. I now have an 11 degree shift in the alignment on the prosthesis. Having worn my moonboot for 5 months, now the prothesis seems to be more fixated than before although not traight. I can walk on it for short distances but sometimes it's just not usable. The surgeon said it will eventually become 100% loose and taking that thing out means a huge operation, for which I was scheduled but just did not have the guts for on 20 July 2016. Being sick and tired of pain and discomfort together with a very hectic schedule just made me stick with what I still have and I chickened out of the operation. Please think twice and read the threads on this forum. TAR is not always the best option, in fact, it can become a nightmare. Maybe I was just unlucky or I did something wrong but my TAR just did not last. The thought of loosing the joint movement is very upsetting for me and that is why I went for the TAR in the first place. I know how you feel and gosh!, if only one could make peace with the no movement idea. It's hard but I, for one has to prepare myself for it for the future. Just look very well after your TAR from the beginning and maybe it will last."

"Hi Mary4013"
"I personally feel the one from the side has the least impact on the nerves and recovery is a breeze…if the Fibula heals properly. No dead spots etc. I have been to the best ankle surgeon in South Africa. He was supposed to take mine out 9 days ago. According to him the placement of the prosthesis was not correct in my case, too far backwards he said, which leads me to believe that the placement of the Zimmer TB system is crucial for success. I have watched animated movies on how it’s done in detail and the way they do it does not leave much room for mistakes so I am not sure how mine ended up to far back. Just make sure your surgeon has done a few of these implants (mine was nr 2 in Africa…big mistake!) and that he has a proven success rate with this type of implants, otherwise you may end up in the same position than what I am in. I know what it feels like wearing a boot, in it myself for months now and having been thru the pain of a busted ankle before TAR, I can honestly say even having a botched TAR is still 100% better than being without it. I can sleep at night without pain and that was a huge luxury before TAR. It has spoiled me to such an extent that I just can’t get it over my heart to have it taken out and risk being on crouches for months. I wish you well and please just follow the rules."

"I had a TAR in September, 2013. The surgeon was supposed to do a subtalar fusion at the same time (which he ""forgot"" to do) and six weeks after surgery, the replacement was recalled. Seems the manufacturer (Zimmer) failed to clean off the implant's polishing material. There were only 100 implanted worldwide so no class action suit or anything. I have had nothing but pain for 3 years. I finally found a new surgeon who has taken a very conservative approach, but finally did the subtalar fusion in February. Still in a lot of pain so I'm going in for arthroscopic surgery in September. If this doesn't get rid of the pain, I don't know what I will do."
"Hello. I am a 57 year old woman who had BOTH ankles replaced November 2015. I had severe bone-on-bone osteoarthritis and I put off surgery until I could no longer tolerate the pain. I am happy with my results as I can walk again!"
"Directly after surgery, I was placed in casts for three weeks then the ""Storm Trooper"" boots after that. I spent one night in the hospital. I had nerve blocks that fell out as soon as I got into the car to go home. I was instructed to get up once an hour in order to prevent blood clots. Yes it was very painful at first. In fact, I asked for refills of the Oxycodone twice."
"My ankles don't hurt anymore bus my back spasms. I think i's because I am not walking the same as I did before. My right ankle still swells a little. My surgeon told me to expect that for at least two years."
"I have numbness on the tops of my feet and toes. For a time, the bottoms of my feet were super sensitive but that seems to have gone away.My right lower leg just started hurting above the ankle. It is very sensitive to touch and just today hurt when walking."
"I am very happy I had the surgery and would have it again (both at the same time)."
"Mamie"
"I had my TAR June 17th, left ankle. No problems in surgery, doctor came out afterward and told my wife everything went ""textbook"". Cast came off and stitches removed on schedule July 5th. I've been off the Oxy's since that time. At that time I was given this monster black boot with a metal plate and hard rubber soles. Sound familiar? I can place 50% weight-bearing. I'm allowed to take it off for 2 hours/day which I've broken up into 3 forty minute sessions in which I work on ROM exercises. I've learned quite a bit reading responses here, thanks for sharing your experiences."
"My concerns, I cannot sleep with this thing on. It's not scheduled to be removed for 3 more weeks, Aug 1st. Is the plantar fasciitis night splint a good alternative if my surgeon allows it? It looks like it would keep the ankle secure while lying in bed."
"Also, my ankle feels best after my shower. Probably the warm water. Does anyone use a heating pad for comfort? I would only use it on a warm or medium setting."
"Thanks for any info you can provide."
"Hello everyone"
"Thank you all for sharing your experiences of ankle replacement surgery. It has helped me come to a decision regarding this."
"I live in the UK and am 68 years old. I am a league tennis player and my business is boarding dogs, who have to be walked twice daily (at least)!"
"35 odd years ago, I had a serious skiiing ankle with an open fracture of the right tibia and fibula just above the boot, just above the ankle. I had a plate put in, in Austria. The London surgeons were very impressed with the handiwork of the Austrian surgeon. However, they cut into the ankle area to put the plate in. I was told that I wouldn't walk properly again, never mind play sport. I have played top class sport all my life and in my younger years I think that I tore every ligament and tendon in that right ankle. I refused to be defeated and after coming out of plaster, I swam every day for about 6 months (6 months on crutches and six months with a stick). It was while I was hurrying back to work after my lunchtime swim (I was late!) that I suddenly stopped and literally SCREAMED, 'I am RUNNING! I am RUNNING!' and burst into tears. I think the London public thought I was demented."
"After that year and a half out, I went back to playing serious hockey and I was FINE. Until now. I am telling you all this, because it was that accident, the orthopaedic surgeon here in Bath UK thinks, which was responsible for my current ankle problem. For several years now I have lived with (intermittent, worse after playing tennis or long walks) serious pain. I have been living on painkillers, capaicin cream and lanzoprazole (for protecting the lining of my stomach from the 400mg/3xday Ibuprofen). It got so bad that the surgeon performed an arthroscopy in November 2014. He told me as I came round from the anaesthetic that he didn't think they had been able to help much. 'See how it goes and maybe we will have to think about a fusion of the ankle'. I totally rejected that as an option. 'I play tennis!', I said. 'No fusion'."
"It is now end July 2016. It hasn't gone well. I have had an MRI scan and am continuing on the painkillers and anti-inflammatories. I also take gabapentin - a strong nerve pain analgesic which, I swear, is the most help for the pain in my ankle, which is constant now. My GP doesn't agree, so again I was referred back to the orthopaedic surgeon (who specialises in ankles)."
"My MRI is showing bone on bone which is why my ankle is so painful. He gave me three options: 1) ankle fusion (NOT an option for me), 2) ankle replacement, which he told me is only 90% successful at present (whereas hip and knee replacements are 98-99% successful) or 3) continue on the painkillers until I literally can't walk. I chose number 3."
"He referred me for orthotics to stabilise the ankle as I am walking with a limp and the knee and the hip are being affected. Going up stairs is extremley difficult, even with the orthotics, because my right quadriceps muscles have reduced in size. My core is also weak, so my balance is affected."
"SO, I thought I would have the ankle replacement surgery. I decided to research it and came across this site. THANK YOU, THANK YOU to everyone who has contributed. After reading right through every comment, I HAVE DECIDED I WILL NOT HAVE THE SURGERY. I am actually quite horrified by some of your stories - more pain and swelling after the op; not being mobile for months on end (how will I play tennis,or walk dogs?); and acceptance of less mobility and less ability to play impact sports. NOT for me!"
"I am hoping that in a few years time (when I really can't walk!), the technique of ankle replacement surgery will have improved."
"In the meantime, I have joined a gym and I swim every day and do thigh strengthening exercises and core strenghtening exercises every day there. Pilates is next. I walk the dogs every day and I have a mini-trampoline at home, which I am trying to use more (against doctors' wishes - but it is a soft, low-impact type of exercise, good for strengthening the core - balance - and using almost every muscle in the body). And, I am still playing league tennis, although I suffer the next day! I will not be defeated!"
"I am sorry, if this is a very long post to read. I just hope that some of the ideas and facts in it resonate with somebody and help them to make a decision whether to go through surgery or not. As one contributer said, every case is different, and you are the best person to decide whether it is suitable for your case, your level of pain. As long as you do your research, as many on here have said, you will decide. Research is the key. No-one else can decide, or influence you. Believe in yourself."
"Good luck to you all!"
"Sandi"
"I see you posted your initial enquiry over a year ago, Ultraboxer, so it should be coming up to two years ago that you had the surgery. I do hope things have improved since that posting and that your life and mobility have improved considerably? Let us know how you are now, won't you?"
"I had my star replacement June 15, 2016. I still have pain but its nothing like I had before the surgery. I was in a cat wreck my foot went through the bottom of The car and was laying up the inside of my leg it was cut so bad. 2004 I had it fussed , because i had bone againat bone , still had pain a lot. Then in November I started having miserable constant pain I was ready for amputation it was so bad. I am still having some pain but nothing like before surgery. I'm still no weight for another couple of weeks.started PT two weeks ago. My ankle is moving it fills like it bends in half. But when I look at my ankle is is moving but not like normal it has been so long since it moved it amazes me how it moves. It has been 24 years since my ankl has really bent. I'm so glad I had the ankle replacement."
"Thank you so much for your information. Can I ask how old your are? I'm 56 and I'm scheduled for surgery Sept6. Star implant and I to had a car wreck. But I ended up with plates and screws. Right now my ankle just has terriable arthritis. I've been wearing a moon boot for 6 months. Cannot walk at all without it or a cane."
"I would like to estabish contact with anyone who has undergone ankle replacement surgery and reflect a ittle on the aftereffects and the longer term prognoses for recovery and mobility."
"Having undergone such an operation about 9 months ago I am currently coming to terms with a less than welcome (and certainly unexpected) imapct upon my life and mobility."

"I am 16 months post ankle replacemt and to be honest only just thinking it was the right operation to go for. I am still in pain but gradually decreasing, slowly getting more mobile and walking better but suffer for two days after a lot of walking. Saying that, a lot I now do I could not do 4 moths ago so i deffinaltley have progress. I have also started riding my road and mountain bikes again (I car ride 20 miles now)."
"I still suffer swelling and stiffness but I have found you need to keep moble. I work at a desk and and as long as I take regular breaks to walk around the building the ankle is a lot happier (if only I had known that 8 months ago)."
"I also started to use a sports support on the ankle at work 4 months ago and it made a huge difference, now only use it now and again (I work 12 hour shifts)."
"I do believe that you need to keep the ankle moving when at work, esspecially if you have a desk job, also you need to work on strengthening the ankle."
"I expect my recovery will take 2 + years, I was expecting 1! I was also expecting miracles from the operation but I believe I was expecting too much."
"I really do now believe it was the right operation to go for instead of the fusion, it just take a lot longer to recover than you expect or hope."
"Will I be 100% pain free, I doubt it but you learn to live with it (I hope)."
"12 Months after the operation I was in a bad place, 4 months later things are looking very positive for me. shed a stone and a half in weight (10% of my b0dy weight). my main goal was to ride bikes agan because it it low impact for the new joint and I have achieved that and hopefully go onto ride a lot further."
"I still take anti inflamitories and painkillers when needed but not as many as time goes by. I suffer calf cramps and calf muscle spasms and will discuss this with my consultant in september."
"My consultand has always said give it time and 4 months again said give it another year and he could be right!"
"I hope this helps."

"Hi I am a tennis player and had severe bone on bone arthritis in both ankles..only one painful..I had my TAR using the STAR prosthetic almost 14 weeks ago with a very experienced CA Cedars Sinai physician specializing in ankles. I was nonweightbearing for two weeks in heavier splint cast, then stitches removed and nonweightbearing for two more weeks in lighter not removable cast. The knee scooter was so helpful for the nonweightbearing period."
"I also purchased a knee pillow to elevate my ankle that was great..Those first 4 weeks were the toughest as I don't do well on pain meds and was off of them after casts came off. I was put in removable moon boot for another 5 weeks and was encouraged to start weight bearing slowly. He gave me ROM exercises to begin. Started with walker then cane. An Ortho doc recommended HOKA shoes for walking after release from the moon boot as they have curved sole to help with adjustment to walking again."
"My doctor said no physical therapy until after X-ray at 8-9 weeks to be sure healing is on track and prosthetic is firmly in place. He allowed me to start pool walking and light swimming. This was helpful for less weight bearing walking."
"After seeing X-ray of good healing my Dr. Recommended physical therapy and allowed bike riding as well as swimming. I have been progressing in physical therapy with increased range of motion and less pain than prior to surgery. I have some numb areas on my foot and get swelling and nerve pain everyday. I am trying to swim or bike ride three times a week and do physical therapy....and work Full-time. I am trying Acupuncture to reduce swelling and nerve pain. I still have to elevate my ankle several rimes a day and ice it at night. Working now on ROM and footwork to return to doubles tennis. With swelling, none of my tennis shoes fit. Had to go to larger size and wider. Birkenstock Orthotics help over insoles with new tennis shoes."
"When thinking would I do the surgery again, after two and three weeks I was seriously questioning my decision but now at 3 months I would say it is worth what you have to go through."
"i am working on patience and reading posts of others helps me see the healing process as one day at a time."
"Thanks to all for your postings and think positively for your healing!"
"I was told that recovery can be up to a year. I am in my seventh week and out of cast and into a walking boot. I just started weight bearing with crutches. How long were you non weight bearing? Is my six weights non weight bearing long enough? For you, my Dr told me that when there is pain and swelling to immediately sit down and elevate foot and ice. Dr said that could be up to one year after surgery. You still are in that time frame. Hang in there and give yourself 3 more months. Good luck!"
"Thank you it's getting better."
"Well in Missouri."
"Hi Kathy."
"It is good to hear something positive. Well done you! And I hope you continue to recover well."
"I too was, frankly, horrified reading people's stories of their continuing problems after ankle replacement surgery. Even you, Kathy, are still having problems 15 months after your surgery with the swelling you mention! Are you abke to run, plsy sport, even gentle stuff?"
"This prospect of being 15 and more months out (of life, as I know it) even though with a fairly positive outcome, together with the other negative outcomes I have read about, has convinced me NOT to have the operation. Not yet. Not until I can no longer walk, run (well, jog slowly) and play my tennis. I feel the risks outweigh the benefits."
"I wish you further improvement with that ankle."
"Regards"

"That is exactly what I am doing. Waiting. Although it is getting worse every day. I too have to put it up between dog walks and tennis. Always in pain after exercise and it swells up!"
"When it gets so bad that I can't play tennis, can't walk at all, then I will revisit the situation."
"Thanks again and i wish you well with your recovery. You certainly had a bad one."
"Best wishes"

"I am so sorry I can understand your pain I've suffered for seven years. I finally had a car in 2012 after struggling for several years walking on what felt like a raw stump I had a tar in my right foot for several months everything was okay then I was barely a able to get around without minimal pain as the years progress the pain progressed and got much more severe I found got an appointment with my surgeon who would done the original tar and he deemed it necessary to remove my existing ankle replacement and Arnel scheduled for surgery next week to have a new replacement installed I'm trying hard to be hopeful and I'm praying of course to God every minute of every day that this works because there was no actual reason for it not to have worked the first time he found nothing wrong with my bone with the appliance it just didn't take for whatever reason I am hopeful very hopeful this time it will take and I will once again be back to my old sales I should tell you I didn't really take a lot of caution the first time I'm extremely active not overweight 62 but very young for my age and maybe push my ankle a little too far at the beginning I won't make the same mistake this time I will go slower and be more careful with myself and try to do no harm and hopefully everything will turn out alright I'll stay in touch and try to let everyone know about my progress but take heart and if your doctor makes you feel bad about yourself and your pain all I can say is dump him immediately there are thousands of very good positions out there insurgents you can take this song and will be happy to help you overcome your pain and suffering don't for a minute let a physician belittle you and your pain it's justified and you need someone who understands and will help you God bless"
"I'm having tar Sept 6.I'm getting very nervous about the whole thing. I've seen good and bad"
"Reviews. I'm getting the Star replacement. How long were you out of work?how long before you were able to walk alone? I have no choice. I was hit by a drunk driver 20 yeasts ago and everything is completely gone. Been wearing a boot for six months."
"Mary I had the Star replacement on April 15th and I am doing really well. The process was longer than I had excepted but I feel it was worth it. Mary I had no pain what so ever.....my doctor gave me a ""nerve cath"" and it was what I believe after reading some of the comments on this site a wonderful thing. I truly think if you have a good doctor, do the recovery as instructed you will be as pleased as I am. I still have swelling but still no pain and looking forward to a beach vacation in about 3 weeks."
"Hope all goes well keep me informed of your progress. Kathy"
"Kathy,thanks so much for commenting. It's so good to hear a good review. I know it's not going to be a walk in the park. But at least I can expect and end to what had been a long ordeal with my ankle. Thanks again"
"I've been reading these comments. My STAR replacement is coming up on Sept.16, 2016. I am still recovering & in a boot since June 2, 2016 surgery for ligament, tendon, bunion, & fallen arch correction. My question is has anyone gone through similar pre-surgeries & how did that interact with their tar. I am quite nervous about this procedure, since I haven't even healed from the earlier one. Still non weight bearing. What am I in for??? I still have all the numbness, pins & needles, limited movement & pain etc. Anyone in a similar situation."
"Wow Mary, sorry to hear a drink driver did that to your ankle! You've been in a boot that long...geez. How r your hips & other foot being uneven for such a long time. I wish you luck & will be following your journey. I'll be 10 days behind you with my star."
"Hi Mary, how is recovery going? I'm getting nervous too, now that it's getting really close to my STAR op."
"Any advice? I hope your healing well"
"Weezer"
"It's going. Finally got my pain meds worked out. Just trying to stay comfortable. Had a shower today, sat on shower stool.totally wore me out. Twisted my back the first day,sliding onto knee walker. That felt awesome"
"..not."
"Just laying around with foot propped on two pillows. Sleeping at night is going ok.everything is about what I expected. Just do what the Dr says,and be very careful."
"Happy to hear your progress is going Mary! Thanks for taking the time to let me know."
"Continued healing & less pain each day. Feeling more confident with hearing all positive reports. Let you know how my STAR goes as well."
"Weezer"
"I've had the star replacement - 1 year ago, been great and I'm back to playing 18 holes at least once a week."
"Was off work about 3/4 months and been back since then."
"Be positive - I know there are some horror stories but just do what the phyiso's say and if you don't get offered any GET IT YOURSELF - it's important."
"I would like to estabish contact with anyone who has undergone ankle replacement surgery and reflect a ittle on the aftereffects and the longer term prognoses for recovery and mobility."
"Having undergone such an operation about 9 months ago I am currently coming to terms with a less than welcome (and certainly unexpected) imapct upon my life and mobility."
"Issues such as lack of mobility, excessive swelling and cronic pain from the ankle itself but also from the toes and lack of sensation and feeling in parts of the foot are those I am facing and would like to know how other poeple have fared, both in the short and longer term."

"Has anybody looking into Stem Cell Therapy? I've been doing some research and it looks like a few high end facilities are having great results. It's a little expensive and insurance doesn't cover it, but the alternative is months of pain and limited movement and the unknown whether anything might go wrong. Just a thought."
"I had my TAR on 11th August this year (2016) just had cast removed yesterday and been given an airboot."
"The inner ankle bone was excruciatingly painful when I started the stretching exercises and have a fair amount of nerve pain down my foot into big toe."
"Foot is numb and semi numb and ok in different places."
"I had a subtular fusion prior to that but I was still bone on bone and in agony and my whole life changed from having a life to having an existence."
"I then had an arthroscopy but it didn't help and 3 years later I'm now at this stage."
"I've got an ice boot from my first op so I'm going to use that ( a bit sort of cryogenics)"
"The swelling has reduced considerably and leg has a fair amount of muscle wastage."
"I've read the posts but I'm trying to stay positive as that's all I've got left."
"I was told to look at 1-2 years for full recovery."
"The same surgeon on each op so hoping he knows his way around my ankle by now lol"
"Wow jeanne, you are a true warrior!! Don't be fooled by the stories of no pain. You will have some level of pain. But everyone tolerates pain differently."
"I don't know which prosthetic you went with, STAR or iInBone? That makes a huge difference as well. What you will have is mobility like you've never had before. The technology is amazing. Hang in there. Follow Drs orders. But don't let them tell you that yoy have no pain if you really do!!"
"Good luck and God Bless"
"Theresa"
"Hi Theresa,"
"Thank you for your reply, having lived with pain and rattling because of pain killers, I can't remember the last time I was pain free."
"Prior to any operation my whole right foot collapsed and I ended up walking on my arch area as my heel was at a 30 degree angle. All nerves squashed in my sinus tarsi and the arch nerves and tendons stretched beyond their limit so was in agony 24/7."
"My only relief was in a swimming pool which I had to be hoisted in and out of like some whaling ship!!"
"I don't know which style I have been given but I will ask on my next visit in 4 weeks time."
"All I know is it feels pain free in the outer ankle area which I had before and now inner ankle painful where it wasn't before lol."
"My other foot/ankle is also on the way out due to over compensating for the right foot, which isn't helped by the air boot putting my legs at different heights."
"I was a Police Officer for 32 years and reaping the benefits of all that walking the beat now!! Am a real 'flat-foot' lol"
"Hi Theresa, I'm sorry your in so much pain. I can relate with your statement about your other foot giving out because of the boot uneveness. That is happening to me as well. I have my ankle replacement soon on left foot, & think that the continued boot use will really make my right ankle worse. I've been in a left boot since June 2nd. I like the pool too, but experienced the hoisting which embarrased me in a public pool. I hope your pain eases up & they go with your ankle healing. I t really sucks to have constant pain. Good luck to you."
"Hi Weezer,"
"I've decided to even myself up and for £20 have just bought a Darco open toe cast boot, which is like a sandal but will bring me up to the same height as the air boot."
"Worth a try I think?"
"Good luck on your up and coming op."
"Just as a by the by my other foot is on its way out too and after the op, the Physios come round and gave me a Zimmer frame wanting to see me use it and kept trying to get me to hop."
"I told them I can't hop because of problems with other foot, they kept on trying to get me to hop but I refused saying it will cause further damage and I wasn't going to do that just so they can tick a box on their statistic form."
"They asked how I was going to get around and I told them I had bought a rollater and I sit on that and push myself around backwards around my house."
"So don't let them bulldoze you into stuff if you know you're not capable."
"Hi Jean, that's why I couldn't use crutches after my 1st surgery. The hoping hurt my other ankle. From time to time if I use it too much because of uneven weight & even on my knee scooter, it will bruise on the inside of ankle & makes it hard to scoot around. So basically I've got two bad ankles at the same time. 1 in a boot after presurgery for tar & 1 in waiting after my tar heals. I know it will be years to recover, but the Dr. Told me that I had to commit to this long way to help my ankles. I agreed. Sometimes it's very difficult to just stay in bed, than difficult if I get up & do to many things. Oh well, just trying to maintain a good pistive attitude"
"Hi Jean"
"I had the replacement 1 year ago and I'm 53, Lambeth officer, it's going really well, still desk bound but to old for front line anyway lol. Don't look like I'm going to be allowed to do Fitness test (MO advice) but I'm going to push for it."
"Good luck with everything"

"I hope things get better for your ankle. It's scary to go through this kind of stuff & not feel any better. Doesn't seem right does it!"

"I truly believe if you find a doctor that has done this type of replacement and do Behar he tells you it will work. I had awesome doctors, no pain after or have had any, no therapy just been the right thing. I am not running any marathons but I didn't before."
"Take your time find a good doctor. Good luck. Kathy"
"Have an experienced doctor and you al will be fine with the STAR. Yes 10 percent at most will have problems but that is life. It was well worth it for me. I walk my dog and mow the lawn and no problems. Look forward to 10 plus years painless walking. Do Not Fear"
"Good to hear BradleySTAR!!!"

"I cannot walk or run, but do ride a bicycle and want to continue."
"For the first 5 days I will have a pain cath. behind the knee and chilled water pack. I had surgery earlier in the year , the pain from the swelling the first night was very bad. I will post an update the week after the surgery."

"Hi, it's comforting that there are others with the same problems as me."
"I had surgery 15 months ago and still get chronic pain and swelling. I have been doing my physio and walking most days. The pain is 20 times worse than before the Op. After new xrays my surgeon is very positive saying all is well and recovery can take another year. It would be interesting to know if anyone else is in the same boat. I'm 72 and am fit except for my ankle."
"Take care all, Chris"
"Hi Chris, I'll be watching the comments you receive. I had surgery on liagments, tendons, fallen arches, bunuion., than an ankle replacement. Im a total of 5 mos p.o. & doing pt. Pain, swelling, limp etc. Wish I knwe how long I will be in this condiotion. I'm 61 &"

"Weezer"
"Hey Weezer,glad your healing. I'm finally not in a boot and wearing shoes. Still feels strange. Still limping,but doing ok.use a cane sometimes. But overall satisfied for right now."
"Hi mary4013,"
"Good to hear from you! Since your out of the boot & in a shoe, do you have to wear an ankle brace while in shoe? I have to wean off boot,& wear a compression stocking with ankle brace while in shoe. Having lots of pain all over. Still doing pt 3xs a week. Maybe it's my previous surgeries that are giving me pain. Those ligAments, tendons never really got therapy. I limp in boot & use cane. By end of day I'm in a lot of pain. I don't know if I'll ever be pain free feeling down & upset that I did this surgery. Wish I had better news to report. I wish you & elwood continued healing,. Keep in touch. Weezer"
"So very sorry to hear your still in alot of pain. I don't wear a brace , I just wear a loose tennis shoe. After walking or standing for about 4 hours, my heal is what hurts me the most. But I am not on any pain meds. Just taking anti inflammatory. Ankle seems to be doing good. I go back to the dr on Nov. 28th. I was not given any therapy except to start walking..I wish you well."
"So happy to hear your ankle is doing well! Let me know how you make out after your Dr. Apt. My next doc apt is Dec 14. I'll keep in touch. Continued healing & happy thanksgiving."

"Many of the replies to your posting do not mention which device was used. The two I saw that had used the STAR device seemed to have the better results. I wonsder if the device used make a big difference."
"Hi terryv99"
"I had star on Sept. 16, 2016. My story slightly different. I had previous surgery June 2, to correct tendins, ligaments, bunion & arch reconstruction. Never did pt & went into star replacement shortly after. I have had forum conversations who just had star & r doing great. Their recovery was rather quick. My recovery slower & more painful due to June 2nd operation. Even my doc said star ankle replacement is easier & quicker to recover from, than my previous surgery. Have you found other replacements that give you more mobility? I guess I like the star, just not my recovery."
"Weezer"
"I had my ankle replacement on Sept 6th.it was an infinity. My doc was awesome. Almost no pain. I'm up walking in tennis shoes. Having some pain in my heel. But overall surgery went well. Haven't done any pt.doc wanted me walking. Go back on Nov 28..."
"I also had some bone spurs removed and a ligament tightened but it sounds like your recovery was was a little harder."
"All I know about the STAR is info from a few web pages. As long as I can walk with out pain after a year, I'd be happy."
"Would I do it again? Yes in a heartbeat! The pain from the ankles was so severe I could not walk or stand for a year and a half."
"I decided to have ankle replacement surgery this month Nov 2016 makes a year! I'm 47 the pain and swelling is threw the roof! I went in to surgery thinking I was getting the inbone implant instead I wake up with and implant that hardly at all in my Tibia! It kills me to walk to the toilet ten steps away! I hate getting out of bed to face the pain! It you are planing to have this surgery make sure they give you the inbone implant! It's 5 to 6 inches into your Tibia. You get the numb your screwed! Recovery plan not to walk for three to eight months on it! Longer you wait to better off you will be! My implant should been tested out on a monkey before using me as the test pilot! God bless us all that have to live with the pain from these short implants! Don't worry if you do have the shorter implants they can be changed out for the inbone implant!!!"
"Hi Mike, had the same thing August 2015. Done all the physio and still limping badly but swelling has improved. 2 weeks ago my local chemist suggested Voltaren dolo 25 mg which has not only eased the pain but now stopped the swelling this is after 16 months of agony. I also use a cane when I have to walk further. Wish you luck 🍀"

"Hi"
"Just found this fourm, I'm 53 and had the total ankle replecment 1 year ago, I'm a london police officer and been back to work for about 6 months now. I'm desk bound at the moment and just been told it's unlikely I will be front line again - I can't pass the bleep test. I feel great though, honestly just keep working at it."
"I hardly have any pain at all, before i could hardly walk."
"I can jog, although I don't think I should, I can do the 3 flights of stairs here everyday, all day, ride my bike and swim, and can now walk 18 holes of golf."
"I'm really happy with the results, i can't say it's been easy i had an infection a month after the replacment and another op, 8 in two years from a motorcycle accident."
"I was really scared at first to even stand, but once i got over this its been really good."
"Ankle is swollen still - but that's no problem, i have almost as much movment in the new right ankle as i do in the left."
"Balance is still a slight problem but I'm working on the strengh - i have had phyiso with the police so can't complain about that."
"I'm told i'm the only police officer with a replacment ( i find that hard to believe ) and wanted to see how others are doing."
"I dont have a lot of feeling in the foot but again you get used to that."
"From what I've read on here it's not all good news but I can't say I've had a bad experiance - it's true to say i won't let this hold me back and i will push myself but all i can say is - i think a lot of the problems can be overcome."
"If i can help in anyway just contact me on here, i can tell you what I can and can't do."

"I worked as a Nurse throughout all this having only retired last year. I never let it affect me."
"The STAR was the 11th operation since the original accident happened as a 28 year old (now 60)."
"Until I moved to Norfolk I had annual reviews at Queens Medical Centre Nottingham but seem to have slipped through the review net in Norfolk. Nevermind."
"Happy to discuss in depth or answer any questions."
"Hello Mary, my friend had ankle replacement on Friday, he is in horrible pain, and has had very little medication for his pain. He wishes he had not had the surgery due to the pain. He has had three unsuccessful surgeries. I'd like know if the primary physician should be checking in on him, since he has other serious conditions."
"I have always thought of surgeons as mechanics, in my experience the primary physician visited me after surgery and the nurse had to phone the surgeon because he had not been in to see me, and she needed his okay to send me home."
"What about transition care? The surgeon talks about discharging him tomorrow, I am concerned about how his wife will manage to care for him, they both are sixty."
"Do you have any advice for his wife? I told her she should call the primary, and ask him to see his patient."
"He should be using pain killers to keep AHEAD of the pain and keep his foot above his heart until the swelling and pain go. Icing his foot will also help reduce pain and swelling."
"Good luck Richard"
"Do you have some suggestions about pain management at home, and"
"what worked at home. Did you use a bed rail to support you getting out"
"of bed, and prevent you from falling out?"
"I went in at 10 am Tuesday and was out by noon on Wednesday, over night, so insurance would pay. No follow up by doctor. I'll see him next week (20th)."
"If they did not give him a pain block he must keep it up and cool. I know that does not sound like much but it makes all the difference. Of course I did have hydrocodne ."
"We have a large and high bed , no rails, so it is easy to slide on and off. I only get up to go to the bathroom and I use crutches to get there."
"I am 67 and had my ankle replaced 12/6/16,I thought I would try to provide regular status updates. Maybe it will help those who may need a TAR."
"The plan was to replace the ankle with a STAR prosthesis. The operation was scheduled for 3 hours but they needed to make some adjustments to my heel and it ended up taking five hours. Since I was under for so long I slept, on and off, for 19 hours. I slept good last night and some today."
"So far there has been no real pain but it is coming. They did a pain block just below the knee which is still working and I have been taking hydrocodone. The pain block will run out sometime tomorrow then I will only be using the hydrocodone. Bye the way, do not take the hydrocodone without food or you may throw up. I also have a cooling pack under all the bandages, this runs ice water around the ankle to keep the swelling down. Based on my previous surgery I recommend the pain block and cooling pad, they have made a big difference."
"Cheers"

"Hi I had a TAR in December 2013. The surgery was done in Nimes (France) and I have an Integra Newdeal. 3 years on and I still have a lot of pain. I hoped I would be more mobile than before the operation, but I don't think I am. So, I am considering an arthrodesis. Has anyone here taken that route?"
"I'm sorry to hear that you are still in a lot of pain after three years post surgery. It would be interesting to know what your situation was prior to the surgery and what has your surgeon had to say about the reason for your pain after all this time?"
"Hello Richard"
"I had a motorbike accident around 40 years ago, damaging my left leg. Around 10 years ago I started getting pain in my left ankle and was diagnosed with post-traumatic arthritis. I had shoe inserts, cortizone injections and 4 years ago was referred to a surgeon in Nimes to consider surgery. I was in hospital for one week, two weeks at home after that, then 6 weeks in a residential centre de rééducation receiving physiotherapy, massage, hydrotherapy etc. (French health service is fantastic). When I was sent home, I had another 30 sessions of physiotherapy in a day centre."
"I have never been free of pain since the op and at my annual review with my surgeon this autumn, he sent me for a CT scan. I saw my surgeon this morning and the scan showed degeneration between the talus and the calcaneus. I am going back for a cortizone injection next week. He suggests that he may consider fixing the talus and calcaneus together in future."
"If the cortizone helps, then I assume that he has found the source of my pain. Fingers crossed!"
"Thanks for the additional information. How very frustrating for you that you are still suffering pain however my gut feeling is that cortizone injections are at best only going to be a short term remedy sadly but I'm not a doctor!"
"I'm in a similar situation having had a very successful TAR four years ago and got my life back and now am having to have bone transplant's due to cysts that threaten to destroy the bone around the fittings. It only showed up a few weeks ago at my annual inspection and now I understand that the tiny fragments of metal and plastic from the joint have caused this to happen. I understand that if you are unlucky this can happen with any replacement joint. It's something that one is not told when the surgery is offered...not good!"
"Anyway best of luck going forward."
"Cheers Richard"
"and manage pain. I had an unsucessful spinal fusion fifty years ago that did not heal, and live with chronic arthritic pain at the surgery srite, and could benefit from having your positive attitude."
"Keep in mind that cortisone shots are just temporary relief and that too many of them can cause damage to your ankle . Have you considered an ankle replacement? I'm 19 months post op and it's the best decision I ever made. I'm completely pain free after 20 years of bone on bone arthritis."
"I would like to estabish contact with anyone who has undergone ankle replacement surgery and reflect a ittle on the aftereffects and the longer term prognoses for recovery and mobility."
"Having undergone such an operation about 9 months ago I am currently coming to terms with a less than welcome (and certainly unexpected) imapct upon my life and mobility."
"Issues such as lack of mobility, excessive swelling and cronic pain from the ankle itself but also from the toes and lack of sensation and feeling in parts of the foot are those I am facing and would like to know how other poeple have fared, both in the short and longer term."

It should provide useful encouragement. Sadly I am told that unknown to me I have cysts that need to be dealt with and pain developing."

"I feel compelled to respond to mellowphil and RichardKen's comments re squash and my new ankle."
"I first picked up a squash racquet in 1958 almost 60 years ago and have played the game ever since. It is a VERY important part of my life. As I have aged & developed orthopoedic issues I have become less competitive and switched from singles to doubles squash many years ago. Doubles squash is an arcane sport only played in North America on a court 45' by 25' by 4 guys with the ball whizzing around at close to 150mph. It is less demanding than singles but much faster. I have explained to my surgeon the start/stop and twisting and turning motions required and he agreed that I could probably play with the Wright inbone prosthetic for the few years I have left (I am now 77). It would be harder on me to not play than to risk damage to my ankle playing ""old man squash""."
"I am now almost 4 weeks post-op and have yet to experience any serious pain. I will start weight-bearing in less than 2 weeks and after insuring the ankle is solid will have my knee on the same side replaced. My other knee was replaced about 3 years ago, again with no pain or swelling and I was playing doubles squash 6 weeks after surgery. I have worked very hard at doing the rehab BEFORE the surgery on my joint replacements. I am also a very lucky guy and as you guys (and gals) know-that luck can change at any time at this age. I do not intend to compromise (too much) on the way I have always lived my life unil I have to. Thanks for ""listening"""

"Like you I'm not easily held back and have continued working full time following my TAR in 2012 which has included a major roofing job involving flagstone like tiles."
"At the same time I was involved in looking after a flock of sheep which is quite physical when it comes to catching and turning them up. All of this rather worried my surgeon but he said that on no account should I run with my new ankle and I am not as the prospect of damaging my ankle was far too important to me!"
"I'm now having to face serious revision work as I have Osteoporosis and perhap brought on"
"All I would say to anyone planning on engaging in sport please think of the possible consequences. I am now facing the possibility down the line of having my leg amputated. This would be really dire after having got my life back for four years."
"TAKE CARE."
"Cheers"

"Hi RichardKen"
"I can only agree with you."
"I had a TAR and it initially felt very good and I walked normally for a few months. My Fibula did not heal as planned. The plate that was supposed to keep it in place did not do its job. Long story short, it all collapsed after 8 months, breaking a screw and my prosthesis tilted 11 degrees. I am in constant pain when I walk now and it's not getting better. My other ankle is also gone due to walking with a Moonboot on the other leg and it needs a TAR or fusion too...so not in good position for a 54 year old man."
"So, please guys... a TAR is not a procedure to make your life normal again so that you can carry on playing squash and doing physical running, excessive walking etc. You cannot go on with your life as usual....maybe for a few years and then you will face the music. Rather accept your situation and live a more restrained lifestyle to protect your mobility. It is something that needs to be appreciated and cherished....wait till you lose it. With a failed TAR, it is a very harsh reality and the possibility of amputation becomes very real as well."
"There is no real ""revision"" for TAR. It means taking out a huge piece of metal from your ankle leaving a substantial cavity. There is one procedure that I was supposed to have had June 2016, but it is very invasive in terms of the time it takes to heal and you have to wear a Taylor spacial frame (not easy) on your leg for up to 9 months. If successful, you can have a fused ankle with little loss of leg length. I just could not have it done due to work related commitments but I am still keeping that option open though. At the end of the day, I will have go for it otherwise I will lose my mobility."
"Just my 2 cent worth."
"Cheers"
"Totally agree with you. I'm a very active 75 year old. I had a total hip prosthetics just over a year ago and did everything I used to do except run as my surgeon said NO! I looked at it as another chance as before the surgery I was forced to give up work and being self employed this was very bad news."
"I have considered the ankle in the same way as I was only able to walk a very short distance before the surgery."
"Having an ankle revision is a VERY different ball game to a hip revision so I do urge everyone to carefully weigh up all the risks before risking damaging the opportunity of decent mobility and with it independence!"
"Cheers Richard"
"Cheers Richard"
"I had a very strict healing regime for the hip, was in a body brace for six weeks and could not bend my leg more than 30 degrees etc. and that I believe is really where the secret lies. Good aftercare and time to heal completely."
"Because an ankle bears much more strain than a hip, the healing process should be taken much more seriously and rather keep weight off for longer than expected."
"If I can have my TAR over today, I will not put any weight on that ankle for at least 4-5 months and make 100% sure the fibula is healed completely before I even start to think of putting weight on it. Halas...water under the bridge for me."
"Cheers"
"Cheers Richard"
"Richard and LDT...I hope my post helps you. I am new to this forum. I suggested to Dr. Yu yesterday a support group for TAR should exist but he said there are so few folks out here that have had this done, there'd be a scarcity of members. However, I joined a support group for several years when I had acoustic neuroma(form of benign brain tumor) and found it a great help. It's a candle in the darkness. So I hope my words help...also, we are more hopeful each time we see the doctor and he says all looks well and last night when I saw Tom without the cane I was positive for the first time in a long while. God bless us, every one. Also, at the airport, I am getting a wheelchair and we will be priority boarding for the first time. So there are perks!"
"You should consider yourself lucky indeed. I have the same. You are quite early in your recovery."
"Wright Technology sold off their Ankle Replacement manufacturing."
"There are so many issues with the prosthetic."
"Keep in close contact with an Orthopedic Surgeon. You never know what might pop up."
"Read my reply to Ultraboxer, and God Speed."
"A brief update on my ankle (12/7) and knee (2/10) replacements - My ankle continues to heal well, although now that I am walking around the swelling is bothersome, so I am taking it easy. I have been surprised by the swelling and pain associated with my knee replacement 10 days ago. I guess I have been lucky up until now and now have to work on it - just like anyone else. I go to the gym everyday and ride a bike to nowhere with no resistance just to get the juices moving around and try to walk a bit - been using just a cane since 5 days post-op"
"I am a lucky guy (but that won't keep me from whining about something!)"
"I would like to estabish contact with anyone who has undergone ankle replacement surgery and reflect a ittle on the aftereffects and the longer term prognoses for recovery and mobility."

"Issues such as lack of mobility, excessive swelling and cronic pain from the ankle itself but also from the toes and lack of sensation and feeling in parts of the foot are those I am facing and would like to know how other poeple have fared, both in the short and longer term."

"My husband had a STAR (Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement) November 9. This was done by a Dr. Yu who studied underDr. Sheskier at NYU Langone. He had a soft cast two weeks, was non weight bearing (and he could not use crutches) for five weeks. He now uses a cane and is in physical therapy. The doctor is pleased with his progress. Tom had end stage bone on bone arthritis in his ankle, which he damaged three times in his 69 years, and the doctor saw that his tendon also needed repair, so while he was in there, he did it. Tom is supposed to wear a protective boot on his left leg, and usually, he does. The pain Tom hasnow mostly comes from where the tendon was repaired but it should get better with use. It has been a tough eight weeks but now we dare to be hopeful. We are going to physical therapy 3x a week and will go to Aruba for three weeks February 10-Mar 3. Doctor says he should do all right... the pain he has now is NOT the arthritic pain he had pre-surgery. He was, by most standards, no longer mobile and spent most of his time in a green recliner with his swollen ankle( after two hours' use)...we have been worried about the newness of ankle replacement but feel we had no choice...and last night, he hobbled around the kitchen eating cereal without his cane and I thought, my gosh....maybe this will really work! So keep heart, everyone!"
"Your post is of great interest to me as I had a consultation at the RNOH in Stanmore with A.G. and wondered if by any chance he is your surgeon. I rather understood that his preference is for the BOX prosthetis so it is interesting that you had the Wright Infinity TAR installed."
"I had a Zenith TAR in 2012 which seemed to be doing well until at my last checkup a few months ago showed that I now have a cyst problem. This will at the very least require that some skilled revision work is carried out to avoid the TAR collapsing and I realised right away that I needed a surgeon who has really good experience and a high degree of skill."
"It is very clear to me that most surgeons in th3e UK who are prepared to carry out a total ankle replacement have not done enough of these procedures to get good at it and certainly are not up to it when it is a revision that is required!"
"Cheers"
"Richard"
"Hi Richard,"
"yes it is A.G. I know he introduced the Wright Prophesy system of preparing for the surgery using the custom made Prophesy guides at the RNOH so it seems a natural choice for me to have had the Wright Infinity TAR. I can only speculate that he might recommend different TAR's depending on each case and need. I am sorry to hear in your case you have developed cysts? Do you know why that happened, was it to do with the replacement or something to do with the original injury?"
"That is great news. The cyst issue is caused by microscopic wear debris from the TAR prosthesis and is called Osteolysis. There is the potential for this to cause the failure of all artificial joints."
"Many ankle surgeons are well aware of this but although they mention the danger of blood clots and infection on their web sites they choose not to be up front about Osteolysis."
"I'm very new to this forum so do not know how to pass on my phone number off list, but would welcome an opportunity to talk before my revision surgery."
"Cheers Richard"
"Dear Bianca"
"That's really excellent news. Wonderful! I cannot really remember how long I had to wait before I was allowed to be partial weight bearing but would guess as t about three to four weeks"
"Golly I did not mean to hit the upload button then as I had more to add! Doing this on my phone!I've just looked at my hospital notes and see that I was partial weight bearing at two weeks."
"I had an invitation from the consultant I saw six weeks ago to attend his NHS clinic and felt that I should go even though I wanted AG to do any revision work to my TAR. He had new X-rays done and said that the upper half of my prosthesis looked to be loose and that I needed a new prosthesis installed."
"I have just today received Mr GBs report for my GP but it was written before he saw the information I sent his secretary so hopefully early next week he will update the report and I should have something more positive to discuss with my GP"
"All the best. Richard"
"I think my wound is much neater and cleaner and am very pleased about that."
"I wish you luck with you discussion with your GP, keep me informed."
"Best wishes"
"Elizabeth"
"Dear Elizabeth"
"Such good news from you. The pictures look good. I found that elevating my leg whilst in the cast greatly reduced swelling. When out of the cast using crepe bandages - ace bandages in the US I think - that had been soaked in water and well wrung out and left in the freezer were a great help when wound around my ankle."
"I've just received the report from your surgeon but unfortunately he wrote it before reading my email to him to make him aware of last weeks X-rays that suggested that the top part of the prosthesis was loose and that a revision prosthesis was necessary. I had been called back by a surgeon I had seen earlier who had new X-rays made."
"This all seems to take such a long time and I'm concerned that the longer the delay the less chance there is of the best outcome. In the meantime I continue to make good progress with the iwalk hands free crutch!"
"Best wishes Richard"
"Hi Richard,"
"how are you? How did the clinic go with the consultant you saw 8 weeks ago go? Hope there is some positive news for you! I am mostly walking about the house comfortably without crutches or knee walker now. I make trips to the supermarket to do shopping and can walk about for about 30-40 minutes using the shopping trolley as a support. I can feel my ankle swells up after 30-40 mins but when I elevate it it goes down within 20-30 mins. The last three weeks in my fibreglass cast have gone very quickly as I am more mobile and I now only have a week till this cast comes off and I go into a boot. I can't wait to wash my leg/foot properly and see how it is dealing with the weight bearing visually."
"best wishes"
"Good to hear from you...do feel free to ring me for a proper chat. Such good news fro you and I'm sure you will go from strength to strength!"
"My visit to London went well and I got on well with AG and my GP is requesting that he does my revision. I had new X-rays as the result of being called back on the NHS by a surgeon I had seen privately in December and he thought that the cysts had now resulted in the top element of the prosthesis becoming loose. This of course knocks out the option of filing the cysts and hoping that will solve the problem, so it will have to be a replacement prosthesis or if the bone does not allow this then it will be a fusion."
"To add to my woes this last Saturday the twenty year old hip replacement on the other side failed! I'm now on crutches and finding life very frustrating whilst the local hospital finds out what prostethis was used and how to sort things out."
"I look forward to talking on the phone some time soon"
"Best wishes"
"Richard"
"Dear Stuart"
"Rather than writing the name of the particular consultant I've chosen to identify him in this way as anyone who knows him will be able to make the connection."
"Hope that helps."

"Hi Richard"
"No problem at all, think I can join the dots, just wasn't sure."
"I'm looking for a consultant in who is pro TAR, would you recommend him?"
"Thanks."
"Hi Richard just wanted to let you know I had my 3 month follow up last week, all good. Did have some pain issues in foot when moving into shoes and tendons started moving again above toes but that is resolved now. Physio yesterday said I had met all targets and had good gait, heel/toe roll and push off. Walking in house in shoes without aid, walking for an hour in boot outside with dogs on uneven ground with no pain issues. I take some painkillers first thing in morning if I think I'm going to have a big day (i.e. Physio, a lot of walking) otherwise I am pretty pain/ache free. Going to go for a swim today to try and build up calf/thigh muscles. How are you doing? When is your hip operation? Have you followed up with a surgeon with regards to getting cysts filled? Best wishes"
"So good to get your three month update. I'm so glad that all is going well and that you sound so positive."
"It's wonderful to hear what you are doing and it will continue I'm sure. Swimming is really excellent exercise. Before my hip failed nearly two months ago I was doing a bit over half a mile every other day and feeling the benefit. Cannot think how to get decent exercise now without doing damage to my left hip or my right ankle!"
"I had the pre op for my hip revision yesterday and have been given May 18th for the surgery."
"As soon as I've recovered I can move onto cyst filling to my ankle on the other side. It is all taking a worrying amount of tie with danger of poisoning from metal particles from the damaged hip joint and increasing degradation due to cysts in the ankle. Still I'm confident that the two surgeons I have lined up are the best for the job."
"All the very best to you."
"Richard"
"hi,"
"So glad to hear everything is going well with your TAR. I'd be curious to know which surgeon used,"
"thank you so much"

"One year ago today I had a TAR at Northwestern Delnor Hospital in Geneva, Illinois. Performed by my awesome surgeon Dr. Gergory Witkowski."
"I now have great range of motion and little pain in the repaired area. The only pain I now suffer is from the Sub-Talus area of the foot that was not repaired. The pain is kept under control with the help of steriod shots every 3 months or so."
"I am currently going to the gym 3-4 days a week to lose weight and get my strength back after years of inactivity. At the gym I will ride a stationary bike and do roughly 15 miles. I am still very careful when going down stairs. I never thought I would get to this point but I feel like I am at 90% recovery."
"Best piece of advice I can give to potential patients is to follow doctors & physical therapist instructions."
"Awesome job! Keep up the great work! I'm 7 months post surgery and I also go the gym."
"It's been a while since you posted your message, but, assuming you or others are interested in a new response, here is mine. I have had similar results from ankle replacement surgery 26 months ago. I'm back to riding bicycles, though I wear a brace now to minimize post ride discomfort. I'm not really inclined to walk for fun, as my ankle hurts somewhat the whole time. I've developed a bunion due to turnout of my foot as I walk, so I look for very wide shoes which, unfortunately, are still not comfortable on my afflicted foot. Finally, I find myself massaging my ankle, ball of the foot and toes with Voltarin every evening in the hope of minimizing the weird conflict of areas still having feeling with other areas which lack perhaps 50% feeling. I'm assuming there is some nerve damage as a result of the surgery."
"This is my first post on this forum...so hello...and apologies if I am digging up an old story that has been dealt with earlier."
"I had an Infinity TAR during September 2016 and my initial treatment seems familiar with many of you who have posted on here...2 weeks in plaster and 4 weeks in a boot. Then physio and general improvement in mobility."
"My stay in hospital was 1 night only...had my op on a Wednesday afternoon and was home by Thursday afternoon. My operation was virtually pain free and the Morphine solution they gave me to take home remains unopened."
"My original injury was down to a classic car/motorbike accident in 1970 that resulted in a compound fracture of my Left Ankle...45 years on the arthritis had got to the bone on bone stage and my ability to walk any distance was much reduced."
"I am now able to walk 3 miles on a regular basis...I have ridden a bike a couple of times with no adverse affects. I take Naproxen daily for it's anti-inflammatory benefits...sometimes I top it up with Paracetamol...and very occasionaly one Tramadol. Overall I am pleased with my ankle and am looking afteer it as best I can."
"I still find stairs a slight problem as I do not have full movement as yet...certainly have as much (at least) than I had pre-op. I use a cane sometimes but not always...depends how far I am going."
"I do have some pain...usually a dull throb that goes with rest."
"The worst thing I have had is shooting pain up the inside of my ankle, and I would really like to hear from anyone else who has experienced this issue. I can be sat pain free, and when I get up and try to walk the pain is very strong, then, after a few steps it goes completely and I can walk ""normally"" again free from pain."
"Does anyone know what causes this, and, how long does it last? I must add that it is not so bad as it was a month ago...but it is still there at times."
"Looking forward to a response...many thanks."
"Thanks"
"Hello Bianca,"
"If this is a repeat...apologies...I thought I replied but not sure if I pressed the wrong button and lost it."
"Weeks 1 & 2 were in a backslab NWB Plaster."
"Week 3 was in a lightweight Fibre glass plaster with PWB."
"Weeks 4 to 6 were in a boot with increase to FWB over that period."
"After that use of crutches/stick/boot was down to my common sense."
"I found the Physio very good and am careful about what I try to do with regard to walks etc. Prefer to go in the morning rather than the afternoon...wear proper walking boots and use a stick...stroll; don't rush."
"Still get a bit sore after a walk but putting feet up always helps."
"Hope this is useful."
"Thanks Bob, thanks that's very helpful, did u hav your TAR in the uk or USA? I will be in the fibreglass cast for weeks 2-6 and then will go into an airboot for another 6 weeks I think, but have been told to increase the amount of FWB from wk 3, am a little nervous about it and mostly get heel pain and my tendon is quite sore at this point when I have walked for 20 mins 50% weight bearing. When in the back slab when I laid down at night I got an excruciating pain from inside ankle up the inside calf, felt like something stabbing into my leg, when I changed plaster I got it the first night but now it's almost disappeared."
"I had my TAR in the UK."
"The original plan was to go straight from a backslab to boot, but a supply issue meant I spent 5 or 6 days in a lightweight plaster as an interim measure. I thought the boot was fantastic and gave me the confidence to get moving a bit without too much discomfort."
"Interesting about your stabbing pains...my time in plaster/boot was mostly with very little pain and discomfort. The worst pains I had were about 1 month ago when I started getting shooting pains up the inside of my operated ankle. This has reduced considerably over the past couple of weeks and my GP is not too concerned...perhaps a strain/sprain that is now repairing. All in all my pain is much less than pre-op and my use of strong pain killers is now almost non-existant."
"Very happy (apart from the stabbing pains last month) with the outcomes so far."
"Hallo Ultraboxer and everyone else here."
"Glad I found this patient.info website and especially this thread."
"After a car accident in which my ankle was badly damaged, now the the pain is getting too much and I have to make a choice between a lot of pain an ankle fusion or TAR."
"It may be my poor searching skills but I was not very successful in finding actual patient and their results, some websites I found where not maintained."
"Unfortunately I cannot (yet) speak for myself but a friend of mine who had TAR about 4-5 years ago is a success story. He had the SALTO implant and he was back on his feet in no time."
"No pain no problems nothing, he is walking frequently for hours."
"After about 4 hours he says it is feeling a bit irritation but that is about it."
"His surgeon will dot the same operation to me but he warned me that although he is specialized he has a significant number of problems with TAR. Now of course I am very interested in real life experience of real patients. Is it be possible to include a table in this website with data like"
"Age of patient at first operation along with the year."
"the make of the implant"
"Where it is done by which surgeon."
"Result after 1 2 3 4 5 .. year"
"Other operations replacement fusion ?"
"Dear Edmund"
"If you are in the level of pain that is not being controlled by Paracetamol then by delaying treatment is not going to be doing you any favours. I'm basing this on several years of reading the discussions on the excellent Yahoo Ankle_joint _replacement forum. it would seem that leaving treatment too long can reduce the amount of movement t ugh at you get ba movement"
"So the message is leaving the surgery too long is likely to result in a reduction of movement."
"I think you should not by concerned at what prosthesis your surgeon will be using but do concern yourself as to the level of experience they have and this really boils down to do they do a decent number of these replacement ankles each year. Here in the UK there are some 200 surgeons listed as doing these with a combined annual number of around 800 replacement ankles a year. Some surgeons are doing quite a number each year so it is pretty that most are perhaps just one or two and this is not enough for what is quite a technical job!"
"If you are in the UK which I suspect you are then there is a national register fiving you"
"In the UK there is a National Register listing the different operations done by each registered surgeon with success rates and this would give you a clue."
"Hope this helps you a bit."
"Cheers Richard"
"EdmundF > RichardKen"
"Thank you for your reply."
"About waiting too long, yes I am aware of the pro’s and con’s."
"To be honest I am afraid of such a definitive operation as TAR."
"The specialized surgeon more or less warned me about the risk involved and the high percentage of “failures”, on the other hand, my acquaintance is extremely happy with his TAR."
"Reading the experiences from other patients here, well, I am not reassured."
"About the differences from different brands of implants, that is a difficult question too, obviously there is still no perfect one. I see some advantage in the “Zimmer” model like less bone loss but most manufacturers have abandoned the “cemented” types."
"( don’t even think I can get one of those here in the Netherlands )"
"You are definitely right about waiting too long and risking movement but with a little exercise I can maintain or even improve the amount movement I have now."
"I will check the Yahoo groups you mentioned, all info is welcome."
"Thank you very much for your advice."
"Hi there,"
"Listen I don't want to be a negative Nelly here, I just want to share with you my journey."
"It wasn't too long after my TAR that I ended up in pain management. I had severe, chronic pain, still do. My body has become addicted to these awful medicine's. I had no idea my life would end up like this."
"I have mobility issues, swelling, can no longer where decent shoes."
"Just recently I was diagnosed with stress fractures in my femur. My Orthopedic Surgeon correlates this damage to the TAR."
"What I can tell you is that after 4 years, I still lay in bed at night thinking ""how in the world can this pain be so bad?"
"I wish you the best."

"Give it some time. I had my replacement at age 48. My ankle was a mess. I was considering amputation. Thank goodness for my ankle replacement as well as my surgeon. My surgeon was well experienced. He has performed over 1000 ankle replacements.i had a few other procedures done to my ankle at the same time as my replacement to ensure its success. I was in chronic pain for almost 20 years but I can now say that at 19 months post op I am pain free."
"I will admit the recovery was painful. I had numbness in my toes and entire top of my foot . It takes about two years to completely recover from this surgery. It took almost a year for the numbness to go away . I still have a tiny bit of numbness at the top of my foot , but it's minimal and doesn't bother me in the slightest.Sometimes you can have pain associated with the toes after this type of surgery. I had pain in my toes before my surgery due to pre existing nerve damage but I had toe surgery six months ago to solve that problem. I don't have the range of movement as a normal ankle would but I walk with a normal gait, bicycle, hike in tough terrain , as well as work 40 hours a week on my feet. I have my life back. I am extremely satisfied with my result. I am curious what type of replacement you received. I received the ""Wright Infinity "" ankle replacement. If you are a user of Facebook I encourage you to join a Facebook group called :"
"""Ankle Replacement Group"" we are over 1000 members strong and we come from all over the world . You can get advice and read about other people's stories. Most are good , a few not so good . I wish you luck . Stay positive! It takes two years to completely recover. Remember: no running or jumping with an ankle replacement. I wish you the best"

"Hello all--I am pleased to have found this site and want to share my experience with you, as I feel quite alone in it! I had TAR 3 years ago at Duke. My surgeon had done 1000 of these with no apparent mishaps. That day, he let the intern manage the sawing and whoops, he didn't stop and sawed through two tendons, an artery, and a major nerve. Totally severed. I am permanently maimed. My foot is basically frozen, except for multiple types of pain, which no one understands. My balance is off and I can walk only minimally--lately had to resort to crutches and the big boot again. At age 75, I am otherwise healthy and had so hoped to be able to dance and hike again! Now I just hope to keep standing and functioning enough to do my own grocery shopping. This is an extremely rare occurrence but Duke is saying it falls within the Standard of Care and thus they refuse to compensate me one iota. I cannot recommend doing this in a teaching hospital. If anyone knows of a similar incidence, I'd appreciate hearing from you. Meanwhile, I am wishing all of you great success with your new ankles. Sometimes it really works well, apparently."
"I would hope that you have had good independent professional legal guidance regarding this."
"Cheers Richard"
"Hi Leah,"
"I'm so sorry you have gone through such an ordeal. One always has to be philosophical about the inherent risk in having surgery, but your situation has an additional layer of negligence which isn't supposed to be part of the risk factor, especially with a surgeon selected for his long experience."
"You're not alone out there with post TAR issues. While my ankle isn't nearly as maimed as yours, I'm finally coming to grips -- two plus years after surgery-- that I'll forever be limited in what I can do. Much like Ultraboxer's experience, my ankle isn't close to what I had hoped for following surgery and plenty of healing time. I guess we need to gauge own own situation and just do the best we can."
"Are you in a position to have a fusion as one means of partially mitigating your situation?"
"If you were treated in the USA, at Duke University, you should immediately consult with medical malpractice attorney's. There are time limits for notice to the providers, and for filing the lawsuit; do not let this pass."
"Thank you, Emile. Actually, I did find a good attorney who was kind enough to try to help me. He appealed to Duke to no avail. In order to go to trial, he needed to find one surgeon who would testify that this incident was negligence and not within the ""standard of care"". He could not find anyone to do this. So, we gave it up and the statute of limitations has passed. It is what it is and I just have to accept it. Life has a way of turning every difficulty into an opportunity, eh?"
"Thank you for your kind response, Ron. Yes, we will do the best we can with what life has given us. I'm actually doing a little better than when I wrote that first note, during a time of great discouragement. I hope you will gradually regain more comfort and mobility."
"Different communities have different perspectives and laws regarding injuries; all accept that negligent driver's should compensate the victim, but some communities allow physicians to hide behind ""standard of care"", which means lots of other people make that same mistake. Let a speeding driver try that defense!"
"I am 4+ years through my ankle surgery and still I have ankle pain and swelling! Is there anyone here having ankle pain after years of injury?"
"Dear Reenee"
"I'm sorry to hear that you are still having some discomfort. It does take a lot longer to get through this than the surgeons would have you understand generally, I think by now you should be feeling pretty good. At twenty weeks I was well on my way. Google search for yogesh total ankle replacement and you will see how I was doing at twenty weeks. At that point in my recovery I was only uncomfortable at times but nothing much and was working a fifteen or so hour day doing building work etc."
"My only suggestion is to ice your ankle and evevate when it is feeling bad and after walking etc. Keep ahead of the pain in your use of pain medication so that your body has a chance to heel. I think this is quite important but would point out that i'm not a doctor!"
"Cheers"

"Hi Reenee,"
"It's been 2 yrs. and 3 months since my TAR, and my ankle still swells and hurts. The pain is kind of an icy hot pain which I can generally tolerate without meds, but it gets old. Like Ultraboxer, who wrote in over a year ago, I'm also experiencing some lack of sensation in my toes and ball of the foot, as well as a nasty bunion and hammer toe I probably picked up from twisting my foot a little as I walk (this probably would have happened with a fusion, too). I recently had partial knee replacement surgery (I was hard on myself when I was young), but that wound is healing up right on schedule. At 67 I'm still very active, so I've been wearing a supporting brace when I cycle and that seems to help. Walking is a chore. I've noticed that wearing sandals seems to wreak less havoc on me in the course of a day than shoes. I'm still working, and I find that removing my shoe in late morning and elevating my foot helps a bit. At the moment, I'm icing the ankle before dinner. Perhaps everything little thing helps! At this point, I don't envision my ankle getting any better, so I'll just deal with it as long as I can."
"I am over 3 years since my TAR. I have always had pain and swelling, and tried to live with it hoping it would get better. A few weeks ago, at my annual review with the surgeon, I really told him that I was not happy with the situation. Everything seems ok on my x rays, so he sent me for a scan. This showed degeneration between my talus and calcaneous. He gave me a shot of cortizone between these bones which really has helped a lot with the pain. So now I am having these bones fused together. My wife is out of the country until the end of April, so I am not having the operation until May 9th. Fingers crossed that this will help."
"Maybe that is something you could get looked at?"
"I had TAR December 28th. It has been 8 weeks. I am walking without boot or cane. Still have moderate pain but not where I had it before surgery. If I'm on it for a short while I get swelling so have to elivate it."
"I have my eye on the prise."
"I can tell you that it can get better, but you'll always be aware of teh difference between the two."
"Let me start by saying I had a total ankle replacement done back in 1977. Yes, you read that right. As of this writing it's been 40yrs ago."
"I was 18 at the time and was more than likely taken advantage of by the doctors. But, I was the one who signed on the dotted line and was legally of age to do so. I just wish I had had someone to advise me to get at least two (if not three) opinions before I naively went along with the replacement. Oh well, life is full of regrets and 20/20 hindsight."
"When I came out of the hospital I was told ***NO***!!!! ABSOLUTELY, NO! weight was to be put on the ankle for the first 3 months. This meant 3 months ina wheelchair. The next 3 months I was on crutches with ""slight"" body weight, followed by 3 months using a cane. Physical therapy started with the use of the crutches. It was a long and very difficult life to adjust to."
"I never ran again, ever. That left out many sports activities I used to enjoy. But life is full of making adjustments. I adjusted the way I did things, using the heel of my foot for many things instead of the instep. Never wore a pair of high heels again (that may have been a blessing in disguise, though some 2 inch pumps would have been nice throughout the years)."
"But I went on and got married, had a child and raised a family. Moved from California to New York and 12 states in between during these 40 yrs. Has It been painless? OH HECK no! But keeping my foot elevated during the worst of times helped."
"Oddly enough it appears that my body (the tibia and fibula) are eroding basically away from the top of the artifical portion of the ankle and now I'm researching my options. Seems there isn't much information on whether an artificial joint can be replaced with another artifical joint. Perhaps fusion is my only option at this point. Which is just about where I'm at anyway. I've lost about 95% of my dorsal motion and close to 80% side motion. So what would I be losing if I go with a removal and fusion. 2"". Yep, that's the length I'll loose (or so I was told 20 or so years ago) in my leg length. Unfortunately for me, I already have a 2 inch difference due to a childhood accident to my growth plate, so another 2 will make it 4 inches, give or take. Didn't mean to get in here and go on a rant. Just wanted to say this: If I had it to do all over again, I think I would. Yes the struggle was hard and the road to recovery was difficult, but I was drug free and pain free for nearly all my adult life concerning this ankle. Yes there was basically always a degree of swelling and motion and weight limitation. But as with everything, it all depends on your personal outlook on life in general. I'm personally optimistic by nature. I always considered myself fortunate, at least I had two feet to walk on."
"Hope your results improve as the ground is always firm beneath your feet."
"That's so amazing that you had an ankle replacement all those years ago. Where you the first?"
"After I had fully recovered which was just over a year most of the time I forgot that I had a replacement ankle joint especially as my movement was very nearly as good as my good one. Just a B shame it is now after four years having to be revised due to osteolysis."
"Cheers Richard"
"I have been putting off replacement surgery for a few years, but I am encouraged by many succes stories, seems the Wright product is most successful. But, in the truly horrible cases, where pain persists, may I suggest the unmentionable - amputation. We have all heard about, and I have personally seen, amazing mobility for people of all ages with a whole new foot/ankle. A Google search will reveal a vast arry of products."
"When my ankle is acting up, I joke about getting a pirate's stump and no pain."
"I recently read an posting from a lady who had to have amputation and it has it's downsides such as sweating of the stump."
"Cheers Richard"
"Putting off the surgery also has consequences, it's such a small area of bone you can really do more damage to it if you leave it too long, knees and hips have so much more bone that putting it off causes less problems fir those replacements."
"Very true and the longer one leaves the surgery the greater the likelihood that one will have less movement in the ankle joint after surgery than could have been the case."
"Remember that if one needs the surgery it is not going to get better...that's just how it is unfortunately!"
"Cheers Richard"
"25 years ago, I had an unfortunate accident (in an ultralight) and shattered both ankles. Lucky for me the surgeon suggested just putting them back together with some screws and plates as a temporary fix. He said they were getting good at hips and knees and sometime in the future I could possibly get an TAR. The arthritis set in and walking without pain was impossible and by the end of the day the ankles looked like balloons. I am now 65 and my parents are both still going at 99 and 100, I decided I could have a lot of living to do. So, 6-weeks ago they installed an Integra Cadence ankle joint and did a subtalar fusion on the left leg."
"Before the procedure, I looked long and hard on the internet and was surprised to find that currently there are several different companies making ankle joints. Each one seems to have its own pro’s and con’s and fit different situations. I would suggest that anyone contemplating a TAR, do some research on the net and don’t be afraid to ask the surgeon some questions. Before the operation I watched the procedure on You Tube, how cool is that! In the end, I did just what he suggested, but at least he knew I had done some homework. Put a shoe on today for the first time."
"I truly enjoy hearing everyone’s story, good and bad. I feel like I am in an exclusive club. I am curious, Anyone else have a Cadence ankle?"
"I would like to estabish contact with anyone who has undergone ankle replacement surgery and reflect a ittle on the aftereffects and the longer term prognoses for recovery and mobility."
"Having undergone such an operation about 9 months ago I am currently coming to terms with a less than welcome (and certainly unexpected) imapct upon my life and mobility."
"Issues such as lack of mobility, excessive swelling and cronic pain from the ankle itself but also from the toes and lack of sensation and feeling in parts of the foot are those I am facing and would like to know how other poeple have fared, both in the short and longer term."

"I've been reading all about the experiences you have had regarding total ankle replacements. I had one 4-1/2 months ago at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. I related to many of the issues you have had or are having. I spent 6 weeks in a total non-weight bearing cast, then into a boot slowly putting weight on the ankle. Also just finished 3 months of physical therapy, religiously doing the exercises at home. When I started PT, I was going in a wheelchair. I was totally walking without a limp when 3 months was up. The surgeon is happy, the PT team was happy and I am happy."
"I know that not all TAR surgeries are this successful, and I was told that from the start. I had a long history with my left ankle, ending with severe arthritis. I had broken both the tibia and fibula at the ankle in 1968, and the surgeon said that is why I was looking for something now. Arthritis had ""attacked"" that ankle to the point that something had to be done. I had been having cortisone shots several times a year, but that just wasn't doing it. I could not walk on grass, sand, rocks, pebbles...only very solid surfaces."
"I feel very fortunate that I seem to be a success story as I am not a kid...72 now, but it has given me so much more mobility. I wish everyone's story was like mine. Looking forward to a few dances at a wedding we are attending in May!"
"Well done however a word of caution. Your ankle will still be very new and therefore quite vulnerable for your May celebrations. It would be so easy and such a shame to harm it at this stage."
"Take care"
"Richard"
"Not sure wat you mean by ""type"" of TAR. I have the Wright ankle joint if that helps."
"Had my ankle replaced June 2016. Then I had a nerve cut in November 2016. I have good days every once in a while. I'm a lot better than I was with my ankle fused. I was no weight for 8 weeks. I still go to PT three times a week."
"Hey, I got a question. I had a severe dislocated ankle trimalleolar fracture (ankle shattered) a few years back and my doctor recently told me if my bone spur removal surgery didn't help my pain that they may fuse my ankle together or do an ankle replacement. I am 20 years old, so I got a lot ahead of me still. But, I am concerned, when they did my reconstruction they had 11 screws and a bar. My body basically rejecteted the metal. I had a huge lump of muscle above the top of my scars where the metal ended. They removed it and that muscle ball went away. I still had a lot of pain though for a few months after that, doctors did an MRI and found a few things. I have told some people that I may get a fusion or a replacement but everyone says no. My pain is affecting my everyday life. It constantly hurts to walk and stand, running or hiking or stairs is out of the question. Is it worth doing the fusion first than ankle replacement or just go to the replacement if my recent surgery doesn't work out?"
"Hello every one, this October 8th will be two years since I had in one tar. I took two pain pills in the hospital for the 3 day stay and have never had to take even a Advil ever since. They gave me my life back I have 0 pain I own a mill shop and work 7 days a week and don't even know my ankle is even there. The fantastic thing about this is I am a polio victim and my leg and ankle was never normal but these fantastic doctors in Miami are mirical workers for sure. I was told by a doctor in Orlando that it could not be done on me, bad doctor. But I'm on my feet all day carrying wood and things and never have any trouble at all. It is fantastic"
"Hi. I am 5 months post TAR. I have no pain but 2/3 of my foot is numb and I have constant swelling as soon as my foot hits the groud in the morning. I'm walking fine and golf (3) times a week but just can't feel my foot."
"The doc had to move a nerve to clean out the arthritis. I'm curious if you have numbness and or swelling? Thanks for the report."
"Hi John , yes I had swelling for a good 8 months nothing in the morning just at times he end of the day. But never had a problem with my foot being numb. I'm on it 12 hours a day and really don't even know it's there because all the pain is gone. I think with operations like this it takes a year for things to get normal again"
"I am curious how you are doing 5 years post TAR? I am a 47 year old with a 1.5 year old ankle tri-malior fracture with syndosmotic rupture repair and ORIF. I suffer cronic pain and am considering/debating TAR or Fusion - or if I should just deal with the existing pain and do nothing. I am mostly concerned with the recovery time given that I am a small business owner and my business requires that I am very active and physical. My doctor told me that its 2 weeks non weight and 2 weeks walking cast - however this forum has me believing that recovery is actually much longer. Can you tell me how you are doing 5 years out? Im thinking right now about going to a podiatrist before I make any decisions."
"Assuming you might still be participating in this forum, Ultraboxer, I'm curious as to how your ankle is doing now. It's been some 2 1/2 years since I had my TAR (STAR) installed, and after a brief initially good response, my ankle is rapidly becoming my major focus in life with consistant pain in the joint and an angry bunion from twisting my foot a somewhat when I walk. I experience daily swelling and loss of feeling along the arch up to the ball of my foot, including my toes."
"I'm being fitted with an orthotic boot in a few days, which I'm told will stabilize the joint and distribute support around the foot and lower leg. Several patients have commented on the efficacy of boot type supports."
"I'm no longer convinced that the TAR was the right choice for me, as my injury occurred almost fifty years ago and resulted in a permanently enlarged ankle. Perhaps in my case, a fusion would have been the better way to go, though there are no absolutes in these situations. More than a few fusion patients have suffered from the ""gold standard"" approach to treating ankle T.A., but fusion does seem to offer a better likelihood of stability and freedom from pain."
"Hi,"
"I've been reading about your recovery. 18 days ago I had the Inbone Total ankle system done in Columbus, Georgia. My main issue is the nerve pain shooting around my foot. There are times I need to use medication to dull the discomfort."
"Have any of you experienced the tingling sensation? If so, what was the time frame that it dissipated."
"I'm looking forward to having more mobility and freedom from this procedure. Many of your posts give me hope."
"Thank you"
"I hope your recovery and mobility gets better!"
"Jeanette/Shanda, I guess I've been lucky. I have not experienced this sensation."
"Wishing you the best."
"I just got my stitches out yesterday and moved into an air boot. I am still no weight bearing for another 3 weeks but they gave me the go ahead to start PT. I'm pretty excited because I haven't had any pain relief since 2013 when I shattered it and my pain is probably around 0-2 daily now. I cannot wait to start walking again and riding and training horses again!!"
"Wonderful news. I wish you the best. Let's stay in touch."
"i broke my ankle 10 years ago, cysts started growing in the fracture, 5 years ago had it repaired. This year my ankle crumbled from arthritis. Had a clean out, had no cartilage. A friend of mine has had both her ankles replaced, she's a marvel. We play golf together. I went to her doctor in Georgia who did her ankles."
"I was given two choices, fusion or replacement. I chose the replacement."
"So, I'm going to monitor my recovery by how you do. I think when I get my stitches out, my foot will feel better, my foot is the only skinny part of my body."
"Thank you so much for your reply."
"Once agin, wishing you the best, my new bested friend."
"Blessings."
"Just checking in to see how you are doing!"
"I am now 2 months out from my TAR. I am in physical therapy 3 days a week. I am still in the boot the majority of the time but I am walking with just an ankle brace and a regular shoe 1-2 hours a day as well. I am 100% weight bearing with no walking assistance (walker or cane). I am 100% pain free most days, although my ankle gets tired and aches at the end of the day after walking on it all day. But overall, I am soooo pleased with my progress and my surgeon is as well!"
"I hope you are doing well and recovering nicely! Hope to hear from you soon!"
"Shanda"
"Hi Michael,"
"Here's my history and an update from today."
"I’m a 66 year old male in relatively good shape."
"On September 1, 1991 I broke both right leg bones and crushed my ankle and heel. I’ve been living with moderate pain and very limited mobility for the past 26 years. I chose not to have a fusion. I waited all those years searching for an ankle replacement that looked good to me."
"Earlier this year I discovered the Inbone Ankle replacement. One of the more difficult things for a surgeon to do during this type of surgery is to remove your ankle and properly align the replacement into the correct position. The Inbone system eliminates this. 6 weeks prior to surgery a CT scan is taken of your ankle. From this your new ankle is manufactured along with the Inbone Prophecy. The Prophecy instructs the surgeon what to remove and how to place the new ankle, thus greatly reducing the chance for human error."
"I had replacement surgery on Friday June 9, 2017 in Hendersonville TN. On Saturday a nurse helped me out of bed and had me stand with weight on both legs. I was able to do this with no problem. I stayed in the hospital one night and was discharged the next afternoon with a splint on my leg and 60 Oxycodone pain pills."
"I had mild pain for 4 days after the surgery and took a total 8 Oxycodones to help relieve the pain during that time. After 4 days I had very little pain. I did take 1 Oxycodone each night to help me sleep for 7 more days. After that I was pain free. I was allowed to shower with full weight on my ankle immediately providing my splint did not get wet. I was able to buy a splint cover for $35 at a local medical supply shop."
"On Wednesday June 28 the splint was removed and I was placed into a hard cast. My next appointment is Wednesday July 19. At that time the cast and all stitches are scheduled to be removed and I expect to be given a walking boot."
"I’m ecstatic with the results so far. I’ll post further updates as time goes by and I begin to walk."
"10/23/2017 - I was in the boot for 6 weeks. Once out of the boot I purchased hiking boots to ensure adequate support for my ankle. I wore those for about two weeks and then went back into my regular Nike sneakers. My muscles/tendons are still a little tight which prevents me from a completely normal gait but I had a 26 year period where my foot was slanted to the right. As I result I had no choice but to walk on the outside of my foot all those years. So it’s I’m 4 months post op with no pain except for some very slight muscles soreness as I work these issues out."
"I’ve read so many horror stories on this site and I feel for those people and wish them well. I’ve had a wonderful experience, so much better than I anticipated. I would highly recommend you consider the Inbone replacement and Marc Tressler. He probably averages about 2 TARs each week and people come from many of our neighboring states to be treated by him based upon previous patient’s testimonials."
"Let me know if I can be of further help and please advise what you decide to do."
"Bruce"
"I saw my surgeon last Thursday, X-ray taken, healing has gone well. He gave me permission to put weight on foot with boot, I start PT Thursday. I feel like a toddler learning to walk again. The pain has subsided, but at night the nerves in foot light up."
"i think the surgery was a success too. I’m looking forward to getting my life back too. I’m so in awe by science, I feel blessed that this was a available for us. My golf game is calling me."
"We are going to California for Christmas, I should be ready for the grandkids and the stairs."
"Once again, I’m so pleased for you. Also, I want to thank you for your suggestions with the medication, it helped me tremendously."
"Sending you positive loving thoughts. Keep me posted of your recovery."
"Jeanette"
"I'm so happy you're progressing good as well! It's all downhill from here! I am sure you will be playing golf very soon! As I will be back riding horses and training!"
"Awe! I'm sure you will have a blast in Cali with the grands! We are heading to New Orleans in November for our friends 40th birthday. Then I'll be heading to NC to visit with my best friend, then it will be off to Italy again for 3-4 weeks. My boyfriend will be working while I'll be relaxing! 😂😂"
"Keep in touch and I'm again so happy for you, and we are very blessed that this was an option for us!!"
"Have a wonderful time on your holiday, you deserve it."
"It's definitely a decision that takes a lot of thought. And there are risks, no doubt about it. In my case at least to this point I couldn't be happier. Good luck, keep us posted."
"Dear Michael"
"It's always a difficult decision to have to make. To be honest I very much doubt if there are any life changing devices waiting to be brought to market."
"What will change is the ability of surgeons to more reliably align the prosthesis more accurately. Along with this more surgeons will have the necessary experience and ability to do a good job."
"I had a TAR five years and after four years it was failing due to osteolysis and in a few days time I'm due to have it revised."
"The prosthetics was badly positioned and set at an angle which would have increased the production of wear debris which has caused my problem."
"I'm in the UK and here we have quite a number of surgeons doing very few TARS each year so the chances of them having the necessary experience for this technically challenging work is not good. The most important thing is to select a surgeon with a lot of experience of this surgery above anything else."
"Hope that helps."
"Cheers Richard"
"I would like to estabish contact with anyone who has undergone ankle replacement surgery and reflect a ittle on the aftereffects and the longer term prognoses for recovery and mobility."

"Hello all! I am new to this group and am hoping to have my spirits lifted. I was diagnosed with end stage arthritis in my left ankle 3 years ago. I am 54. My first surgery was done by a dr in Winston Salem nc and it was pretty much just a clean out and stimulation of csrtledge to try and save it. That lasted about a year. The pain returned. I then saw another dr who suggested that I needed a total fusion. I didn't like the sound of that so I asked for other options. He said I wasn't a good candidate for Replacement so I was then fitted with a leather lace up boot which I wore for a year. The pain continued to worsen. I was eating tramadol like M&ms. I decided to go get another opinion , my third. This dr said I could benefit from a partial fusion, but that down the road I was def looking at a replacement. I went ahead with the partial fusion. I had it I. December of 2016. Long story longer (haha) it didn't alleviate all of my pain. Sooooo sept 1 2017 I had a TAR. My dr is also one of 4 who designed my implant. It's the integra Cadence. I wore the big bulky cast out of surgery and came home the same day. 10 days later I was out into a hard cast. 10 days after that the hard cast and staples were removed and I was put in a walking boot. Up until the walking boot I was non weight bearing. Now, one week in with the walking boot and I am still using crutches because of the pain. It's not as severe as before surgery but any weight I put on that foot causes a very uncomfortable pain. I know I have a ways to go, but I am petrified that I have now been thru 3 surgeries and still have pain. I want to cry every day. I elevate and ice it. I know it's going to take time but I'm so scared that this is my Lot in life from now on. I feel I am borderline depressed because of this. I nanny for a living and I have been out of work since the surgery. I'm afraid I won't be able to keep up with the 1.5 year old when I do go back to work. I will be in this walking boot until October 9, about 11 more days and then I will go into my regular shoes. I cannot go for very long at all without feeling pain enough to make me sit down and ice it and prop it up. I am so scared."
"Hi donna18009"
"Having read your story I just felt I had to make a quick comment. My story is somewhere on this link but I also have a TAR, it is not very successful although it is far better than what I had before. My other ankle is screaming for a fusion or a TAR as well now. I also have a Total Hip replacement for 10 years."
"I like what I see of the Cadence system. My advice to you will only be two things and that is first, to please keep weight off that ankle for at least 3 months to give your body time to grow bone into the spongy metal coating on the prosthesis and only when you are 100% positive that it is 100% fixated, then you can start with weight bearing...secondly, please don't smoke any cigarettes while your body is healing and getting accustomed to the prosthesis as one draw on a cigarette constrains bone growth for 17 days, according to my ankle specialist."
"You have the rest of your life to get the muscles going and the ligaments supple again but you only have one chance to get that piece of metal to properly become part of your body, and believe me, the prospects of having a failed TAR removed are grim...very very grim. Rather over do it than risk loosing what you have now. The forces at play when you walk on the ankle prosthesis are tremendous. Give it time to heal, you will never regret it. I gave my hip 6 weeks without bending more than 35 degrees (doctor's orders) and very little weight bearing (normally you walk with a hip replacement in a few days) and after 10 years, it's still the best joint in my body. Sadly I did not do the same with my ankle due to circumstances and I profoundly regret it ."

"I had my TAR five years ago when I was 71 and I think I was drinking at about seven weeks. It was a manual car BTW. You can see how I was walking a d coping with stairs in a short video by putting yogesh total ankle replacement into Google."
"A year ago it was found that I had advanced osteolysis in the bones to and bottom of the prosthesis. I am going in for my pre. Op tomorrow with rescue surgery in mid October."
"Frankly this is not a good situation to be in because a revision looks unlikely to work and a fusion for the same reasons looks doubtful due to the condition of the bones due to the osteolysis."
"For anyone considering a TAR please, please only entrust the work to a surgeon who is really experienced at doing this procedure and is doing a lit of them."
"The top part of my prosthesis seems from what my very experienced revision surgeon says was put in at the wrong angle and displaced which could have been responsible for the osteolysis taking a hold."
"Osteolysis is thought to be caused by microscopic wear debris from the prosthesis. The body can deal with a small amount it seems but if the joint is incorrectly installed there is likely to be more wear debris than the body can handle."
"I gad a hip replacement twenty years ago which has only just been revised as the plot cup had worn through ad e did not suffer from osteolysis over all those years if hard physical work."

"Thankyou SO MUCH for your response. I am petrified of it not working so I have followed my doctors orders to the T. He is the one who has instructed me to do weight bearing in the boot with crutches. Should I not be doing this?? As I said, he is one of the group of 4 doctors who developed this implant. I trust him fully. Of the three doctors I have had he is the one I trust 100%. I think I am trying to get further along quickly so I can get back towork for monetary reasons. I don't want to screw this up. I realize this is it for me. If this doesn't do the trick then I will most likely just have the foot and ankle removed. Not what I want at all. I do feel pressured tho to ""get along with it"". I thought since he knows this device like the back of his hand that what he's telling me to do was okay. I'm going to continue to slowly weight bear in the boot using crutches but I'm not going to push myself like I have been. God I hope I haven't already done damage. Pray it hasn't. Please. And thankyou SO MICH for your response. I would love to hear from someone else who's had the INTEGRA CADENCE ankle replacement. I know back in the beginning of this year there were issues with the procedure if the implant. Not necessarily the actual device itself. Those have been corrected. My dr has put in well over 100 of these so far. Only 400 total have been used to date. I'm excited and worried and nervous. Thanks be to god that I found this forum. You people are wonderful."
"Dear Donna,"
"Bless you??. Fear is such a powerful emotion. I'm four weeks out from my replacement. I had a great deal of pain from nerves in foot, they were on fire. I was prescribed neurotin to help, it has. Plus I couldn't wear the cast, my foot swelled tremdously. Last week had my stitches out, moving foot back and forth. Still no weight baring now and for another four weeks. Doc wants bone to adhere to device."
"Please be patient. Talk to your doctor about your anxiety and depression. When my fear pops up, I tell it to go into another neighborhood."
"You are not alone my friend."
"Blessings??"
"Please don't get me wrong, I don't want to tell the doctor what to do, but it is exactly what my doc also told me and I followed his advice to the letter. I had a Fibula that was not completely healed after the operation and my doctor told me that the plate with 5 screws will keep it in place and I can walk on my ankle... one screw broke and the Fibula caved in shifting the prosthesis 11 degrees... and that obviously caused it to become loose because it is not well aligned anymore. Now the fibula is healed ..not straight...I never did anything my doctor did not approve of but I know I could have given it an extra 2 months and if that little bone was healed, it would have been a total different story."
"Point for me is that no doctor really knows what is best because these implants are pretty new (mine 2nd in Africa of this particular type) so my reasoning is, give it max chance of complete recuperation and then you will not have it on your conscience if things do go wrong. Keeping it still a while longer will not hurt but stepping on it one day too early will result in a lifetime of wanting to kick your own backside."
"I totally understand what you're saying. I KNOW that this is my final chance at getting this right. i am feeling a bit of pressure from the employer and the husband at times, understandable but they just don't get it. and they mean no harm, and I am probably putting this pressure on myself. The lack of income creates a stress on my husband and the lack of help puts a stress on my employer. I just feel so torn. I'm not quite 4 weeks out yet I feel like I've been down forever. When I put weight on it in the boot I feel pain in the same area I had before the surgery which terrifies me and makes the first thing that comes to my mind is that it didn't work. I haven't had the nerve pains that you have but my big toe is basically dead. I can't raise or lower it. They say this should come back after PT. Fingers crossed."
"I can quite understand where you are coming from but as someone who had a TAR five years ago and it all seemed to be going well but was not I would just say this. Take time and DO NOT RUSH your recovery whatever the pressure from work, money or home."
"Also you only have one real chance to get your recovery right but the doctor does not have to live with your problems but you do. That is important to remember. If you read what I wrote to LDT 10 hours ago you will see that I seemed to have made a good recovery but perhaps because of surgeon mistakes I now have to suffer the consequences..... the surgeon does no have to!"
"Please take your time."
"Good luck"

"I’m looking forward to PT tomorrow and expanding my physical abilities."
"Thank you for your update, keep us posted."
"Can you tell us what device you went with?"
"Yes, my Dr is Dr Selene Parekh with Duke Hospital in Durham,NC. My device is a newer one. Integra Cadence. My Dr is one of the team of four who created this device so I fee like he had a personal stake in making me a success story and I a to succeed. ;o). I’ve heard that once you stop complaining about the pain and about the ankle that you are there. Well I’m here to tell you that I’m not there YET but I do find myself not thinking about it now and again which is HUGE for me! I will continue to report here as I progress. Thanks again for all the support everyone on here brings. You are right, there are MANY degrees of recovery and I really think it all depends on what issues you began with. Mine were quite severe so I cannot expect to just recover within a few months when it took years to get me to where I needed the TAR. fingers crossed!"

"I respect your request, but am not 100% sure it is all compliant with the surgeon, hospital, and device. A lot has to do with the condition patient was in previously, and the directions given/followed afterwards. I'll be more than happy to share that info once I am further out from my surgery date. 4 weeks is hardly enough time to make a good or bad judgment in my opinion. After reading some postings stating that they got up and walked 2 weeks out of surgery with zero pain and zero meds makes me second guess my own progress, but has absolutely nothing to do with my dr. I've sent a note to my doctor about my issues after chatting with a few of you on here and I will report back on what the answers were. I'm just so happy to see and hear stories (good and bad) of others during their recovery period ;o)"
"Hi Emile, My surgeon's name is Dr. Marc Tressler. He practices in Hendersonville, TN. He has performed over 750 TARs. He uses the Infinity Inbone/Prophecy TAR. My surgery was June 9 of this year. I had some mild pain for 4 or 5 days after surgery and nothing since other than muscle soreness, etc. I was in a splint for 3 weeks, then a cast for 3 weeks. When the cast was removed my stitches were also removed and I was then placed into a walking boot with crutches for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks in a boot with no crutches. I'm now 16 weeks post surgery and feeling great! The pain I had for 26 years is now gone. I'm able to walk on a treadmill for the first time since 1991. As you stated the surgeon, location and device used make a huge difference. I've had NONE of the problems that are so prevalent in discussions on this forum."
"Cheers Richard"
"Hello Folks,"
"I'm brand new to this forum and am planning a TAR with either Dr. Chris Coetzee or Dr. Robert Anderson."
"Both accomplished surgeons & I'm having trouble choosing. Any opinions?"
"Tried to get an appointment with Coetzee at Twin City Ortho, but it was a two year wait. Got my first one done with Dr.Pat Ebling last Feb, also Twin city Ortho. Getting the other one Nov 13. Have you picked what joint you are going to use. I have an Intagra cadence and its been great, so far . Are you in Mn?"
"Pete,"
"I'm in Madison, WI. Coetzee's admin says he uses STAR. I'm considering Dr. Anderson and his Wright Infinity. I'm torn between who to go with - both I believe are top-of-their field."
"My five year old ankle is about to be replaced and it will be a bit of an epic simply due to osteolysis. Be aware of the danger and ask your surgeon to check the latest x rays at every check up. Consider continuing with these checks after you have been signed off because it can come and bit you with no warning."
"A this will save someone having problems in the future."
"Cheers Richard"
"Missing word. NOT usually talked about .....Osteolysis. There is plenty of information on the internet if you dig a bit. If you need more information please ask me as I've had to learn quite a bit about it to know in which direction to go with my revision."
"Cheers"
"Richard"
"Keep me posted on what you decide."
"Hi Lshjr,"
"Did you have that done in North Carolina or Wisconsin? He's moving/moved to WI. He told me he helped design the Infinity. I'm still struggling to choose between him or Coetzee at Twin Cities Ortho. Both top surgeons. Any additional insight on Anderson? How many times will you see him in the 90 day after surgery?"
"Thanks Randy"
"Randy,"
"Mine was in NC. He said he would have limited surgery availability in NC after the first of the year due to the Wisconsin move, so I actually moved mine up, reworked my schedule and went ahead with it. I don't really have any insight on him; I saw him once in April, then right before and after my surgery. Extremely nice guy, intense and very confidant. Everyone I spoke with says he is the man. He helped design both the Inbone and the Infinity and has done a bunch of them. I am following up with a guy in Knoxville who did his residency under Anderson. He sent my x-ray over and consulted with Anderson. He has done about 30 Infinity's and been here only a year, so he wasn't around when I started trying to find someone. Everything I read is go with a guy who has done a bunch of the one you are going to have."
"I just noticed Coetzee was in Twin Cities. Interesting because I located Anderson through the Viking's trainer when my niece's husband, Toby Gerhart, was with the Vikings. I asked him to find out who the NFL thought was the top ankle guy and he said Anderson is where all the pros go. When I researched Anderson, that was confirmed. Coetzee's name did not come up for whatever reason."
"August 30th I had the Prophecy inbone done in Columbus, Georgia. I’m walking in a boot, pain free, PT three times per week. See doctor Dec. 7th, hope to get out of boot and resume my golf life. Dr. McClusky did my ankle, very pleased with his attentiveness and precision."
"Good luck,"
"Jeanette"
"Wow,"
"I sought Coetzee & now Anderson because both were listed on the top ~16 ankle surgeons in the country. Coetzee is a lecturer/trainer/practitioner on the Salto & assume he's done hundreds over the past year. He serves the Vikings much like Anderson does the Packers/Panthers I assume. Interesting that your Toby didn't mention Coetzee - that is very curious to me. Interested to know why? He would certainly know of him?"
"You sound satisfied so far - what will be the extent of you activities when all healed up? Walking 18 holes of golf?"
"Randy"
"Good Luck from Mn"
"I think Anderson may have been the Vikings team doc at the time. It was 4-5 years ago I started looking around, then it took me nearly 3 years to get in to see Anderson. Toby's trainer got the information, so he may have just been partial to Anderson; I don't really know. I am pleased so far. I went to a boot at 2 weeks, partial weight bearing at 3 wks. Stitches came out today and I move to 2/3 weight bearing on Wed of this week. My goal is to walk without pain and walk up inclines like a human, not a duck. I'm sure I can get back to cycling without pain which is my form of exercise these days. Biggest deal is no pain. My foot hurt for years due to bone on bone pain."
"Good luck with whatever route you go."
"Great feedback - thanks. Best of luck & please post your progress."

"Hello Lynda,"
"I am happy to hear that your STAR is performing well for you. It is encouraging to me as I also have a STAR and so far I Love my STAR also. Been almost 2.5 years now and my ""ankle"" has never felt better. I too have hardly any pain now but yes when on my feet a lot, a little discomfort but heck that is to be expected with a normal ankle at my age of 56. I wish you many more years of pain free walking. We must count our blessings everyday as many are not as lucky as we are. But then again many more are happy with the STAR. I think about how good it is everyday as I went 10 years with a bad ankle before my wife convinced me to do something about it. Thank goodness for the lady in my life!! I also wish the best to all with this problem we have had. I just want all to know how difficult a bad ankle can be. It can really wear you down in life. Please take the step to improve your life with this technology if you are a candidate. It is a tough surgery but I would do it all over again. The reward is wonderful. Take Care Lynda."
"I am 4 weeks 3 days post operation. I had a Wright infinity TAR and a ligament reconstruction at the Royal national orthapaedic hospital in London performed by mr Goldberg as part of the TARVA (Total ankle replacement versus arthrodesis) clinical trials. I was 4 weeks nwb. I am now in a plaster and boot and I am pwb. Since the op the pain in my ankle joint has disappeared although the ligaments are a bit sore since pwb. I think I will be in in an aircast boot at 6 weeks and then a brace 3-6 months. Very happy with outcome to date."
"Can you tell us why Wright has different models and when a certain model is used and when the other model is used? Personally I like to have the Wright Inbone type but since I live in Europe Netherlands, I cannot even find any information where get the Inbone operation."
"Hello-"
"I'm a newbie here. I'm looking around the internet for any information I can find on TAR. I live in the US here in the Houston, TX area. I've been living with and tolerating severe ankle pains for around 15 years now. Last week, I finally had them examined by an orthopedic surgeon and the bottom line is he recommended TAR. I was devastated. Those old injuries in my past has finally come back to haunt me. Before seeing this doctor, I never even heard of TAR. In all honesty, the whole idea scares the bejesus out of me. I'm not rushing to get my bones sawed off so I've made appointments to see 2 more specialists in the next couple of weeks to get their opinions. In the meanwhile, I'm doing as much research as I can. I want to know more from people that had TAR done. I want to find out what others have gone or going through before I do this. I want to know if this is truly my best option. I'm 54, not obese (though I could lose maybe 8 to 10 pounds), a bit muscular, and pretty athletic.... back in my younger days anyway. I want to go back to being more active again without worrying the about the severe pain on being on my feet."
"Is there anyone on this forum from the Texas? Can you recommend a specialist who's done TAR?"
"Regards,"
"Joe"
"Hello. I am new to this forum, but it has been great to hear everyone's stories. I have become more educated on the subject and I have more questions for my doctor too. I had a triple arthrodesis or total fusion of my ankle 37 years ago from a football injury. This ended my college career and I have not been able to run, so to speak, for the past 37 years. I have lived a fairly active life during these years, always understood my limitations and always wore custom orthotics too. A few months ago, I slipped and felt my weight come crashing down on my bad ankle and noticed that is started to swell much greater than it normally does. I was concerned that I might have damaged the fusion. I immediately contacted an orthopedist and knew that I needed some xrays to see what was going on. I was fortunate to see a Foot and Ankle Specialist, although he was not far removed out of school and he was amazed to see my ankle fusion and the staples still in my foot. Good news, the fusion was totally intact and he complimented the surgeon who performed this surgery 37 years ago. Bad news, my foot was badly tilting inward, I had severe arthritis in my mid foot and the start of arthritis in my ankle joint. We have treated the injury as a sprain and I started to do my research on what is next for my ankle. The Dr. did say that at some time I would most likely need a TAR, but he was concerned that at age 56 I was too young."
"As I returned home, I started to do more research on TAR, the procedure, the implements and surgeons. I actually sent an email to the department head at Duke U. Foot and Ankle Department and found that their surgeons have a very good success rate with TAR and he invited me down for a consult. Again, I think these guys where just amazed to see a 37 year old fusion. LOL Duke is only a 2.5 hr drive from me and I have been there many times in the past and played on their football field prior to the injury."
"I was told I would be a very good candidate for TAR. Since I had a triple, my ankle is one huge piece of bone, so no issues with the bone. I was also told that I would need to have my heel moved to realign my ankle position. So, now we are talking two major surgeries and they some what conflict with rehab of each one."
"At this point, I have not made my mind up. I have lived with this ankle for 37 years. In the past 10-15 years, I have lived with pain and discomfort every day, but I push through it. I have to limit how much activity I can do and I might need to have a rest day between higher activity days, but not sure I am ready to jump in and get this done. I can not hike on trails, I relegate my activity levels to walking on hard paved roads and my competitive dog training days are almost over with. I have to have more discussions with my doctors to determine what can I expect after surgery. Will I still have the discomfort in my mid foot with TAR?? After the realignment of my heel, how does that effect my mid foot too?? I have no doubt, after reading so many of you on this forum, that the TAR will help with the ankle, especially as I continue to develop arthritis in the ankle, but so many questions still remain."
"Thank you for sharing and your real life experiences will help me and guide me toward the right decision at some point and as I have always done, I will jump in and push on when the time is right."
"Hello, after almost 5 mos after my My TAR I let my surgeon know that after he took me out of the walking boot within 2 days my foot swelled to the size of an orange & had such extreme pain i was barely able to continue with physical therapy."
"He ordered an MRI &found that I had a stress fracture on my heel. No reason for how it happened. But I do know he fractured my tibia removing my ankle, and there was a large wound right where my 'stress fracture' is. Which is the very first place I told the nurse when I first woke up in the hospital where I felt the most pain! Not the incision where my ankle was removed, not where the screws were put after he broke my tibia, removing my ankle, but my heal. That is where the pain was coming from the most!!! What do I do? I just found out? My surgeon spent like 3 minutes with me, telling me it's probably because of my soft bones. (I had a bone density test done after the surgery and I was told I was doing pretty darn good for my age, 57, having Ostopenia, which I truth believe because my younger sister and mother both were diagnosed with osteoporosis over 10 years ago."
"I don't know what to say at this point. It's Christmastime and I have 5 granddaughters, & 1 grandson. Some are blood-related, some are step. I love them all, almost equally...well gosh, y'all know. But anyways I am relegated to restrictions to a fractured heel, to which I believe resulted from my initial surgery."
"Please tell me your thoughts ??"
"13 months ago I had a right TAR with STAR prosthesis plus subtalar joint fusion. That one was more of a nightmare. I ended up with an entrapped flexor Hallicus longus tendon which cause what is called a checkrein deformity of the great toe. This has caused severe pain in the right great MP joint. Hopefully this is going to be resolved in a month when my surgeon goes back in and severs the FHL tendon. I’m keeping my fingers crossed."
"It took me a full year to recover from the right subtalar fusion. The right TAR part of my surgery last year was much quicker to get over. However the MP joint pain has been very severe."
"This time around the left TAR seems to be a breeze."
"I'm 12 days out from my right TAR as well.This will be the second to this ankle. The first one only lasted 3 years, it was a star. But I had my left ankle done the same year as my right and the left is still doing well. I had them all done as a out patient. This surgery after the first night the nerve blcked stopped working and I was in bad pain for 2 days then it got better. Now I'm just about done with the narcs and don't take much tylenol. Not much swelling and the stitches come out in 2 days.Bored.From Boulder CO."
"Good luck to you."
"Last time, my nerve block never took and I woke up from anesthesia in utter agony. The resident just did not get it into the right spot. This time with the opposite. I just had my first game today at some of the stitches taken out. I'm out of the cast and in a boot which is so much more comfortable. No swelling because I am keeping it elevated religiously 100% of the time. Luckily my computer keeps crashing, so I have something to do other than watch the snow fall In Syracuse, NY"
"Typo: should have stated: ""first post op visit today and had some of the stitches removed"""
"Cheers Richard"
"Hi, Sorry to hear about your TAR failure also. Unknown what caused my failure. The ""pads"" that move together had just disintegrated. Doctor replaced them and that lasted only one month then pain started again. I was kind of hard on the original TAR, rock climbing etc. but had the other ankle done in the same year and it's doing ok. The one I had replaced 2 weeks ago the bones beneath the original replacement were not solid enough to support it (osteolysis, I don't know). I'm a RN but have the attitude that it is what it is, just fix it. I have total faith in my doctor. I'm 59 years old."
"Don't know if that helped or if I made myself clear? I wish you the best. I wonder what your options are?"
"It stinks that your is failing so soon too. Anymore questions I can try to help you with just ask me."
"Dear Chip"
"Many thanks for the explanation. Seems rather odd that the poly wear block disintergrated rather than wore down and as I understand it the prosthesis has now failed again. Yikes!"
"In my case the surgeon badly positioned the top part of the prosthesis as can be seen in the attached picture so much so that it looks as if he had to chop a bit out of the fibula! My new surgeon tells me that the prosthesis is also set at the wrong angle by I think he said 20 degrees. All this seems to have resulted in osteolysis and you should be able to see two large cysts one each side of the top element of the prosthesis. I understand that there are several small ones elsewhere."
"I'm gutted as I seemed to be doing well and had been carrying on my building and farming work and not sparing myself although I'm now 76."
"Cheers Richard"
"Absolutely. Positioning and every aspect of the surgery is critical and there is very little room for error which is why the incidence of problems is quite high in the UK where I live where quite a number of surgeons do very few TAR replacement each year. Result is that few get to gain the necessary experience. It is essential to find a very experienced surgeon in the procedure."
"Cheers, Richard"
"Wow what a bunch of crap you had to put up with. Thanks for the X-ray it's very interesting. Still farming and building at 76 your badass, that's great! Your pain is tolerable? Keep in touch."
"Chip"
"Thanks, glad to have been able to share that X ray which is about three months old. Looking back to the original ones shows the prosthesis in the same position. If you are interested in seeing how I was walking and trotting up and down stairs at 20 weeks post op. search google for yogesh total ankle replacement."
"Cheers Richard"
"I compared my recent xray of the infinity replacement to what appears to be the inbone on yours. amazing difference in fit it appears."
"Dear Chip"
"I packed in farming and building a couple of years ago to sell up and move to a different part of the UK so ce when the ankle went wrong and then my twenty year old hip replacement wore out so it has been all quite a difficult time."
"I'm not in pain at the moment, just a bit of discomfort at times when I've been on my feet too long. I very much doubt if anyone could tell that I've had my hip revised or that I have a TAR."
"I've been given an ankle support device to support the ankle whilst waiting for the surgery."
"Cheers, Richard"
"Thanks for posting your two X rays. Very neat job unlike my Zenith prosthesis."
"Cheers Richard"

"I just did a PubMed (NIH National Library of Medicine search engine) search using key terms: DVT and knee walker, thrombophlebitis and knee walker, knee walker and DVT, knee walker and thrombophlebitis and came up with zero hits. I googled the question and came up with a couple of anecdotal notations, one by a podiatrist who suggested that his patient may have had his DVT caused by keeping his knee bent using a knee walker. This is all hypothetical and conjecture. There is no question that any lower extremity trauma or surgery can predispose to DVT. Years ago, there was a lot in the literature stating that DVT could be demonstrated in greater than 50% of patients post hip surgery (I can't recall the exact number but it may have been more like 70%. I think unless a person has a contraindication to anticoagulants, everyone should discuss with their surgeon post op anti coagulation for a month for DVT prophylaxis with lovenox, coumadin, xarelto, or one of the other anticoagulants which have been approved for this use by FDA. (Aspirin has not been shown to help). While anticoagulation is not without risk, particularly bleeding (GI, cerebral, etc) which can be life threatening, the risk of DVT and PE is very real, and probably of much greater risk than complications of anticoagulation. They have been shown to work and clearly reduce DVT post op lower extremity surgery or trauma. One must never take NSAIDS or aspirin while on anticoagulation, and always check with your physician before starting any other meds, prescription or OTC, while on anticoagulation because there are a lot of potential interactions. Also,with coumadin (warfarin) there are serious dietary interactions one must familiarize yourself with. Frequent exercise of your legs throughout the day can also help prevent clots. Hope this is helpful."
"PS: with regard to ice machines, I would not waste your money. Remember that you will only be using this for a few weeks. Certainly icing and elevating the leg are very helpful in pain control and reducing swelling. You should follow your doctor's advice on this. Rather than an ice machine I recommend a Chattanooga I track later call pack which you can buy on the Internet for around $20. Below is one site that I found a company selling them for $21. You just pop them in the freezer for an hour and then it says call for about a half hour . They are cheap, simple, easy to use, we could be using the pool all sorts of problems. They last a long time. This is what most physical therapist use."
"I had TAR in July 2017 of my left ankle. I had my third round of GCT Giant Cell Tumor in my ankle bone which was removed for the 3rd time and an ankle replacement or fusion were my only options as the bone had eroded from multiple tumors. Has anyone else had GCT in their ankle with recurrence? Has anyone had the achilles lengthening surgery when they had the TAR? I did not have the lengthening surgery and now my surgeon is recommending it. It has been nearly 6 months since my surgery and I walk with a limp and cannot push my knee forward with my foot straight on the floor. I have pain in the ankle still and it seems to sort of lock up after sitting or resting the ankle. Feel like I can't take a step as locked up. Does anyone else have that? Also walking down stairs or down hill is not at all easy. I don't feel the tightness in the back of my ankle but in the front but I have pain in my shin and inner ankle and wondering if the surgery will fix that?"
"I had TAR this past September 1st. Although I have some upward movement of my foot and am able to bed my knee when standing flat I do experience some of the same things you are. After sitting for even a short amount of time my ankle stiffens up tremendously. I’ve become accustomed to working it back and forth the entire time I am sitting so it won’t be as bad, but at the end of the day, if I sit down to watch a show and then stand up it’s almost like it has seized up. Takes me a few minutes to actually take a step. I also have the downstairs down hill issues, but- I also had a partial fusion done last December so I feel that contributes to the difficulties. My dr wanted a 30 degree movement as my recovery goal and at the end of my pt I am at 40 degrees so I’m happy with that. I find that the more I move during the day the better off I am in the evenings and also the next day. If I take a “me” day and binge watch Netflix all day then it’s stiffer even the following day. I do feel like I have progressed greatly and still have more months to continue improvement. I have not had any muscular/tendon problems though. They say after the one year mark you actually have days where you don’t even think about it. Can’t wait for those days to arrive! Good luck!"
"I am also 7 weeks out from left TAR (no subtalar fusion). I have been walking for 1 week. My left Achilles is very tight, and yesterday I injured it walking slowly on a flat surface. I am have been stretching it several times per day manually with a heavy rubber stretch band, using a treadmill at a slow pace, and using an elliptical machine with low resistance. I find the elliptical particularly to be very helpful. I think yesterday I did not do enough stretching before the walking and will focus on more aggressive stretching multiple times per day. Have you tried an elliptical machine for this Fankle?"
"Hi I actually have an elliptical machine which I was aloud to use eventually after my last two surgeries. and I will mention this to my doctor this week to see if that will be an option. I did get on it about a week ago and feeling alot of pain in front of ankle so not sure Im ready for it yet but definitely want to try all options! I was doing alot of stretching at PT initially and did the treadmill gait stretch alot, but it just seemed that all efforts still didnt stretch it ""enough"". Wall stretch was always excruciating so was unsure if that is good or bad! So sort of let it rest for awhile only walking and a few stretches here and there for the last month. Anxious to try something else!"

"It's been almost four years since my TAR, and I feel that I'm finally coming to terms with a result that is far from my expectations of a perfect, new, mechanical ankle. My surgeon has been unhelpful in post op appointments, expressing interest only in X-rays indicating that his surgery was successful. It may indeed have been successful, but my ankle sure ached! Through another orthopedist, I had a boot orthotic made which helps align my sagging joint. Subsequently, I had a custom pair of boots made which accomplish the same but without the pain of rigid plastic pressing onto my ankle."
"I can still ride a bicycle, which is great, but I always wear one of those hockey player lace-up braces. It really helps in providing support, and importantly, it helps to forestall the achy pain which would otherwise visit me later."
"I have numbness in my toes, ball of the foot and along the arch, but it's OK! I'm ambulatory, many people have far worse problems and happily, I'm not in severe chronic pain."
"I strongly suggest that you look into supplemental support for your ankle. Obviously, what works will vary from one person to another, but you need to keep experimenting with anything which might aid you. Your life with a TAR will hopefully be a long term relationship, though not necessarily an easy one."
"Four years and you still have these problems; you picked the wrong surgeon, and you can't go back. Except, I have seen amputees with amazing mobility, and no pain. Check the hardware available now, its way past the old pirate's peg leg."
"Ten weeks post op, week two of therapy and I have nothing but positive feelings regarding operation. Should have done sooner."
"That said, I must talk to the only real pain I have had and from the response of others I am not the norm, but believe anyone contemplating this op should be aware of. From what I understand nerves are not cut, but do get moved around, handled, etc. and in my case are have been slow to return to what might be considered correct function. I have since the stitches were removed experienced shocks, burning, and other random pulse type pain that I don't remember anyone else mentioning. It has/is improving, but this pain responds to nothing and I have pretty much just endured. No prescription antidepressant, no over the counter pain reliever, etc. have all been of noand inturn sleeping has been poor at best. Just as I start to sleep a zing of pain shoots through my foot and brings me back fully awake."
"Please don't let this turn you off especially if you have had the issues that make replacement your next or only option. I am amazed at the results and would do again (probably the other one as it is just as bad). Don't no if this is of any interest, but best of luck and if you have any questions please feel free to write."
"The recovery period is difficult, with my surgeon requiring six weeks of no weight-bearing. This leads to a tremendous amount of atrophy and weakness of the legs. It helps to exercise your legs multiple times per day when you’re not weight-bearing and the push yourself one weight bearing is allowed."
"Now I am quite functional with relatively minor pain requiring Tylenol as needed."
"My right subtalar fusion 15 months ago has probably posed the most difficult recovery. However, the more I exercise and walk, the stronger my ankles and legs are getting. My wife and I are currently on a cross-country road trip, having traveled about 7000 miles before my left TAR in the fall, and another 4000 miles past six weeks. The second leg of the trip began 5 werks after being allowed to bear weight. I was able to walk about 11 miles over two days in Las Vegas a month ago, and many miles along the south rim of the Grand Canyon, and just finished playing 18 holes of golf today."
"For me the surgery has been nothing but a miracle."
"I have not experienced any of the shooting pains that Kenneth describes. That does sounds difficult."
"I’ve been involved in this blog for quite a few months, and the most recurrent theme that I have seen is the advice to be sure you hire a surgeon who has performed a lot of these. I agree with this whole heartedly. There are many prostheses being used, but I think which prosthesis to use is secondary to which surgeon to use. The foot and ankle are much more intricate than hips and knees, and therefore the most important ingredient for success is a surgeon with a lot of experience in the procedure."
"Dear David"
"I put a lengthy reply together many hours ago and just as I was about to press send I had to plug it into the phone charger and it vanished, lost forever! So here goes again."
"Total ankle replacement surgery is very critical in many ways because we know the ankle joint is amazing in so many ways quite apart from being such a small joint when compared to the hip joint yet taking the same weight plus the weight of the leg. It is a universal joint, a shock absorber and a propulsion unit all rolled into one!"
"As a result it is critical that the load of one's body is carried straight through the prosthesis from the tibia. It is also critical that all the angles are correctly planned out before the surgery so that there is no flying by the seat of their pants by the surgeon."
"My TAR done in 2012 seemed to have been a great success with certain concerns on the part of the surgeon though he failed to bring a major fault to my attention at any of our follow up appointments. It was only when I moved to another part of the country into a different heath authority and obtained my x rays and notes that the problems became obvious to me."
"My original surgeon had spotted something at about six months that made us both very concerned indeed and it was what is called Osteolysis. This is basically the bone becoming destroyed by tiny holes that become steadily larger and known as cysts. This situation was carefully watched and at the three year point was considered to be not getting any worse thankfully and we both relaxed."
"At my four year annual consultation my surgeon shattered my world completly by telling me that the osteolysis had returned with a vengence and that cyst filling was all that he could offer me and did not hold out much hope that this was any more than a temporary band aid fix. It was then obviously to me at that point that this surgeon who I had put so much trust in was not capable of dealing with the problem in a way that would give me my independence for the future back and that I would have to find a surgeon with the necessary experience who could."
"Finding the right surgeon was complicated because a few months earlier I had moved a couple of hundred miles into a different health authority area. For speed I had to pay for copies of my x rays, CT scans and notes so that I had the necessary when visiting possible surgeon's to discuss possibilities"
"This was the first time that I could have a careful look at what had gone on and I was firstly surprised to read a mention of cysts or a cyst in the area of the surgery site but nothing to say what corrective action had need taken. The second and just as worrying revelation was realizing that the prosthesis had been inserted so far out of a central position in my tibia that to get it it in he had had to choo out a section of my tibia! This made a nonsense of putti g my body weight loading straight through the prosthesis of course."
"I need to say that it is thought that osteolysis is thought to be caused by the wear debris from the poly spacer that is between the upper and bottom metal parts that make up the prosthesis interacting with one's body causing a rejection and resulting in the bone destroying cysts called osteolysis. The greater the friction the greater the amount of debris created. It is quite obvious that the more out of position that the prosthesis js the greater and faster will be the creation of this wear debris sludge."
"It took me months of researching to find the right surgeon to do my revision then to transfer to his NHS list and then just when the surgery was weeks away my twenty year old hip replacement on the other side failed so back to square one to find a great hip revision surgeon. This all took many months before I could have the surgery and by the time I had recovered I had to start at the beginning of my ankle surgeon's list"
"OK this is all getting far too long and to a avoid loosing it all I'm going to hit send."
"Cheers, Richard"
"To add to my long posting the revision involved a considerable number of visits to the surgeon and due to his location each took a day. The planning that went into the planning by the surgeon and his team was very considerable and must have cost a huge amount."
"The actual surgery was carried out out on February 26th and took six hours and generally went well and I'm not just started very limited but progressive weight bearing but will be in a hard cast for about ten weeks. Ugh! There was a lot of filling to clean out the large cysts and repair the damage caused by the badly positioned hole where the earlier prosthesis had been."
"Guys please, please only let a very experienced ankle surgeon carry out a TAR. In the UK there are quite a number of surgeons prepared to carry out this surgery but most are doing perhaps only five a year which means it is very experimental most of the time and it is people like my revision surgeon who has to put the mess right at huge expense if indeed it is possible. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
"I'm 76 so having to deal with all that has been involved in this revision has been very tough but the really hard work starts in five or more weeks time assuming all is well!"
"Guys, the recovery from a good primary TAR is very demanding and is far worse usually than a hip replacement so ankle joint (TAR) surgery should be given the respect it deserves. I'm happy to try to answer any questions you might have, Cheers Richard"
"Thank you for input and suggestions. My Infinity was a front of the ankle unit and as I said, best outcome to date that I could have expected. Currently I am using Gabapentine for nerve issue to no avail, but it seems to be lessening so I will give it the benefit of the doubt. If this is nerve pain I never want to experience shingles or diabetic issues. Operation pain was handled well and in reality very bearable. I'm still amazed on how much I can do already and no longer have so many odd pains (used to bring tears to my eyes if I slipped my shoe on too quickly). Best wishes for your surgery and hopefully no new nerve issues."
"Darn, I was hoping the Gabapentin would give you some relief. 300mg is a starting dose. I've been told you can take up to six 300 mg tablets daily."
"Glad you brought up the surgical pain issue. Did you have a nerve block for the surgery? If so, 12 hour or 24 hour block? Just want to gear myself up for whatever lies ahead. I'm pretty flexible, 70 years old, pretty adaptable. Compared to bone on bone deterioration of joint, I'm looking forward to doing this surgery."
"I feel as if I’ve been given a new life, I’m so grateful for science."
"Wish yiu the best."
"Jeanette, Currently I'm taking 300mg gabapentine daily and really not sure it's helping or if it is I fear for the day script runs out. How long did you use it and any side affects or issues when you stopped? At the moment I can almost deal with discomfort during the day, but sleeping is a joke at best (2-3 hrs, wake up for no apparent reason, hour to two to get back to sleep, up again in a couple hours)."
"Any info would be appreciated and congratulations on your success."
"Good suggestion, thanks. You know how it is, you start writing a posting and it goes on much longer than you had expected and in my case very much longer!"
"Cheers Richard"
"I would like to estabish contact with anyone who has undergone ankle replacement surgery and reflect a ittle on the aftereffects and the longer term prognoses for recovery and mobility."
"Having undergone such an operation about 9 months ago I am currently coming to terms with a less than welcome (and certainly unexpected) imapct upon my life and mobility."
"Issues such as lack of mobility, excessive swelling and cronic pain from the ankle itself but also from the toes and lack of sensation and feeling in parts of the foot are those I am facing and would like to know how other poeple have fared, both in the short and longer term."

"I had a TAR done on December 4, 2017 so I'm now about 4 months post surgery. Overall, I am very pleased with the results. I had the STAR implant by Stryker installed by Dr. Shannon Rush in Palo Alto, CA. He's an excellent surgeon. The most important decision you need to make is finding the best surgeon. I probably saw 8-10 surgeon's before settling on Dr Rush (however, some of those surgeon's were general foot & ankle orthos who did not specialize in replacements). You need to find a surgeon who has performed a ton of ankle replacements!"
"Also, I highly recommend adding exercise modalities like Pilates to your post surgery recovery routine. As I suffered from severe osteoarthritis in my left ankle for years, my body heavily compensated causing all sort of attendant issues in the hips, back, shoulder, opposite knee, etc. No doubt I am preaching to the choir as everyone else on this thread has similar issues. But, it will take time to unwind all those other body issues and physical therapy on the recovering ankle will do little to address those other problems.... so, pay attention to your entire body and not just the affected ankle. The good news is that your body will (should) respond much better after surgery now that the ankle moves again!"
"BTW, at four months post surgery I can now ride my bike for 60 minutes in the hills and I just hit the waves in the surf on my standup paddle board. But, while my walking gait is much better than before surgery, my ankle tires after about 1.5 miles (hopefully that change over time). While my new ankle is not perfect in many ways (still working through stiffness, weakness and a few minor clicks, etc), it is SO much better than before. I put this decision off for a few years dreading the thought of cutting and removing my (crappy) ankle. But, I can honestly say, at least for me, it was a great decision."
"Dan,"
"No issues with random nerve pain? I'm about 38 days behind you and while I believe it is improving the random nerve pain has been a bit unexpected. I believe it is not the Norma's I've only found one or two mentions in this forum. As I will most likely need to have left ankle done sometime in the future I would like more info on nerve response. If you have any insight I would appreciate same."
"Thanks and best wishes."
"Fortunately, I do not have any random nerve pain. I've got pain in the ligament or tendon bundles on the outside of my ankle, but I'm hoping that will work itself out over time as I get stronger and the joint loosens up. Regardless, that pain is far less than the old bone-on-bone pain. So, I can't really complain."
"Excellent. I'm glad it is going well for you. I believe that the feeling of electric shocks, burning sensation, random itching, etc. are becoming less frequent and as I work ankle through therapy and use expected and warranted muscle pain is more often observed. Not sleeping is by far the worst result of my operation and I attribute the coming wide awake to random pain. Still believe operation and replacement was the best choice and like you stated it is way better than bone on bone pain. Be well and enjoy the return of painless movement."
"Dan"
"?I am being set to do the replacement. I am very anxious and saw your positive comments and see you had yours done recently. I have bothersome arthritis in my ankle and painful to the point I can't think right in winter so feel I can't live like this any more. They are offering the Infinity TAR by Wright. Have you heard of it and know if it is as good as the STAR ? I worry I will be worse off with a replacement and very hessitant"
"IMO the Wright Infinity prosthesis is the more advanced option . I had their Invision as a revision seven weeks ago and it seems to have been successful though it will be a couple of months before I know."
"I hope that you have chosen a surgeon who is experienced in using this particular prosthesis and has done a lot of successful TARs. This is REALLY essential."
"Good luck, Richard"
"David,"
"I had an Infinity replacement on June 9, 2017. It was the best decision I've ever made. I came out with no more pain than I had going in and after 3 days stopped my pain medication with the exception of 1 pill each night at bedtime for about a week more. I'm 10 months out now and I don't even think about my ankle. I experienced some discomfort on occasion for a month or 2 as I began to walk without crutches as my muscles and tendons began to work again. I strongly encourage you to chose a surgeon with a lot of experience in TARs. My surgeon had performed over 750 ankle replacements prior to doing mine last year. Good luck."
"Richard"
"?I am not good with using the computer or internet . I'm in with Dr. Erroll Bailey with Resurgens Orthopedics in Atlanta who is ""supposed"" to be about the best surgeon at this but I have no evedince that he has done many of them of the Infinity besides what his staff says and who knows how accurate that is. Have you heard of him and Resurgens Ortho ? Do you know how to find out on the internet is he has done a lot of them ? I need a friend who can help me check ? Can you by any chance ? If not I understand"
"?David"
"Bruce"
"?You are one of the few positive ones I see on line or on this chat room. I am set to go with Dr. Erroll Bailey at Resurgens Ortho in Atlanta and he stresses the Infinity TAR. Have you heard of him or do you know how to find out if he has done a lot of the Infinity's ? I have no way to really know how many TAR's he has done. Have you heard of him ? So you did the Infinity and after 10 months you don't even feel like you even had a TAR and are like new ?....David"
"David, it will never be like my original ankle prior to my accident but pain free and able to walk at a quick pace on a treadmill with no pain. I'm in the Nashville TN area. My surgeon is Dr. Marc Tressler in Hendersonville TN. There are only 3 surgeons in the US who have performed more TARs than him. That said I did some internet searches on Dr. Bailey in Atlanta and he sounds like someone I would trust. One of the most difficult steps in a TAR is removal of the original ankle and placement of the new one. The Infinity system takes that decision away from the surgeon via their Prophecy guide. That leaves much less chance for human error. As my doctor says you have humans operating on humans, there are never any guarantees. My opinion is if you go with the Infinity and Dr. Bailey you have a good chance of getting the best possible outcome."
"David: I have had both ankles done in Rochester, NY, using the STAR, right one 12/16, and the left 11/17 and am doing well with them both."
"""Supposed to be the best at this"" There is no such rating system for doctors, therefore such statements are meaningless. You have to find the right doctor for you. Do not be shy. Ask him/her, not staff, how many he/she has done, how long he /she has been performing TAR's, with what prostheses, and why, how many complications he/she has had, and what kind. Visit with several surgeons, even if that requires travel, and ask each one how the same questions. Bring with you a written list of such questions to each visit. In my opinion, you want someone who has done a minimum of 40-50, but preferably over 100."
"Ask your PCP, general orthopedist, or physical therapist to help you identify several ankle/foot surgeons who are known to do TAR's. Physical therapists know which surgeons are good and which are not, because they see the results postoperative. If you don't know any PT's, ask a friend or your PCP if they do. Keep in mind that you are the purchaser of the service, they are the vendors. Stay in the driver's seat on this. Too many patients see themselves as beholden to their doctors. Turn this dynamic around. The doctor should be beholden to the patient. If not, find another doctor. No good doctor is afraid of such a dynamic."
"I see that you have had some good advice already. I will take this opportunity to remind everyone who has had a TAR to ask their surgeon to check for any evidence of OSTEOLYSIS when they have periodic x rays. Osteolysis which is the development of cysts in the bone will lead to the failure of your prosthesis if not attended to."
"Cheers Richard"
"Hi David,"
"Yes, I've heard of the Infinity by Wright. Biggest difference I understand is that the STAR has a mobile bearing plate while the Infinity (and Inbone) have fixed bearing plates. In fact, I believe (or was told) that the STAR is the only implant that has a mobile bearing plate. What this mean is that the bearing surface, which is more or less a super high-tech grade of a plastic cutting board material, is not physically attached to either the tibia plate or the talas plate. As such, the purported advantage is that the bearing plate will not put undue strain (e.g. pull against) the metal plates that attach to the tibia and talas bones. This also allows for varus and valgus movement (twisting toward and away from your body's centerline)."
"I'd suggest Googling ""pros and cons of TAR ankle STAR vs Inbone vs Infinity,"" and also spending time on the manufacturers websites. Most device manufactures have animated videos of the surgical procedures and how the device functions. And, in the case of Stryker, who makes the STAR device, you can even watch a cadaver video of the surgery, if you have the stomach for it."
"Caveat, while I did discuss the Infinity and Inbone with my surgeon(s), I'll note that most of the surgeons who advised me were big fans of the STAR (very comfortable with installing it and have had great success with their patients). In short, they were much more familiar with Stryker's STAR versus Wright Medical's Inbone or Infinity device. And, adding to Bruce34866's comment about the Infinity device having a guide for the surgeon's, the STAR device also had a very advanced guide. I have no doubt all the manufacturers do at this point in time."
"Also, I agree with two other important points raised so far -- get in decent shape before your surgery, to the best of your ability, and focus on the recover. Do exactly what the surgeon says regarding recovery, do lots physical therapy and other forms for recovery (pilates, yoga, walking, biking, etc)."
"And, the most important aspect of this entire endeavor is finding a really, really experienced surgeon. Best of luck!"
"Bruce"
"?Your comments are encouraging. Did you do the Wright Infinity brand or what brand ? Have you heard of Resurgens Ortho in Atlanta Dr. Erroll Bailey ? I chose him off the internet and don't have any way of knowing how many he has done besides what his staff tells me which is hundreds. I have bunions on both feet and worried about how it will all turn out. I am 57. How old are you if you don't mind me asking and what was your pain level that made you do the TAR ?.... thank you....David"
"I had a TAR in July 2017. Mine was complicated because I had 2 surgeries prior to remove bone tumors and this third surgery needed a bone tumor removed as well. I had a custom ankle made and needed cadaver bone as well. I had recovery times on the passed two surgeries of like 4-6 mths but this one was a lot longer. Im 10 months in and still not walking at 100% but Im getting there now!!! I had the pain at night a lot waking me up, stiffness etc. That is getting a lot better finally! My surgeon told me right away after surgery that my Achilles may be too tight but we would work on that and sure enough that was a huge problem. He could have fixed that in the surgery but he wanted all the rest of the areas of the ankle to heal properly and not add another area to heal all at once! Ive been walking with a huge limp and the leg would not bend properly. I could have had another surgery to fix it but didn't want to do that, so we are working on the stretching with a custom made brace that I wear only when Im sitting down with leg up and it slowly stretches the tendon! I get measured when I go back to doc and it is definitely working but it is a slow process! I also still have episodes where it sort of feels like it locks up so i have to let it sort of adjust before taking too many steps at once. This happens after sitting for awhile or when I wake up in the morning and the first few steps. Stairs are also not good especially going down still but getting there! Making progress, was one hell of a long ride for me! But I'm praying that this will be it as far as recurrences and surgeries and I will be on my way back to a more normal life soon! I have lost jobs and fell into depression, and Im slowly trying to crawl my way back!! I work out and go for slow walks to also help with the stretching. At one point I did the PT but it was so excruciating all due to this tendon I guess. In my case I believe this was the only choice either that or the fusion, but this option gives me more mobility ! Good luck to all and keep the faith!"
"Hello frankle"
"It sounds as if you are having a tough time with your recovery if your TAR. I'm into week eleven having had a five year old badly installed prosthesis removed and a special revision put back in it's place and cyst filling with a bone mixture."
"The surgery took six hours and was done here in the UK by an experienced ankle revision surgeon and was complicated as the damage done by the badly positioned first one had to be worked around!"
"I've been walking in normal shoes with a simple ankle brace for protection for a week and driving for that time. If I plan on walking for longer than ten minutes at a stretch my surgeon had asked me to put on the Aircast boot."
"My walking in normal shoes without crutches is excellent with hardly any sign of a limp so I think I'm very lucky. Oh I'm 76 BTW. Cheers Richard"
"I would like to estabish contact with anyone who has undergone ankle replacement surgery and reflect a ittle on the aftereffects and the longer term prognoses for recovery and mobility."

"Hi Ultraboxer!"
"I had total ankle replacement surgery 5 months ago. It took 3 months for the incision to heal and I have been in PT 3 times a week for 2 months now I am walking without assistance but still have pain, swelling and numbness. It's still hard for me to walk heel to toe but PT is getting me closer to waking normal each week. My doctor tells me it will be a full year until I'm almost completely recovered. Last Friday I met 8 other ankle replacement patients and was immensely pleased to see how they have recovered completely. You would never know they had an artificial ankle. They walked with a normal gait. The name of my ankle prosthesis is the Infinity Inbone Ankle Replacement Prosthesis. I have 7 more months to go, and I hope to be walking normally by then."
"Good luck for a full recovery."
"Gigi"
"?David here headed to do that same Infinity Inbone and worried sick after seeing so many bad testimonials. How did you find the group of others recovering that you can meet and talk to ? I live in Atlanta and can't find anyone. So you feel it is a GOOD thing and I should go for it ? I am on the fence and may postpone it out of fear. I also have knee arthritis and bunions both feet and worry it may all be in vain . How old are you if you don't mind me asking ? I'm 57 ....I am happy for your recovery and testimonial...finally an encouragement vs so many bad ones that make me feel I night as well just fuse and be done"
"Hi David!"
"I met the group of Ankle Replacement Patients during a photo shoot. Most of them are one year in already. I'm only five months in and am not nearly healed yet. I'm 54."
"My ankle is still swollen and stiff. I still have discomfort and am hoping by my year Anniversary, I am fully healed and devoid of any pain. Every patient is different. I met a patient who is much older than me and healed muck quicker than I."
"Your decision should be based on your quality of life. From what I have read, a fusion takes about the same time to heal."
"If you are unsure, I would do more research and see if you can ascertain more information to make a definitive decision."
"I have done quite a bit of reading and research and get so overwhelmed it causes fear in the end. But I know one day will come when I have to do something. This last JAN-MAR in Atlanta was tough...cold wet, etc I ached like hell and that's when I insisted with my insurance co. they cover the TAR. Now it's spring and I don't hurt nearly as bad and the process is in motion set for August and I am 50/50 now. How does one find out how good a surgeon is ? Is there any site that rates TAR surgeons and the number of ops. they have done for how long etc ? Let's keep in touch. We all need each other. Sounds like you are clearly about there and will be SOON God in the middle"
"Hi David!"
"My ankle was so bad, I couldn't walk half a block without it getting stuck in motion. It would take a half hour at bed time just to get it comfortable so I could fall asleep."
"My doctor offered me phone numbers of patients to contact for feedback on their surgeries. There aren't many surgeons in my area that perform total ankle replacements."
"I found my surgeon through research and his credentials were excellent. So far, all of his patients that I have met are doing very well and claim they would do it all over again."
"I am not feeling that way yet. Like I said previously, I am not healed yet, and it's a long recovery. This is a big decision and not to be taken lightly. It took three months for my incision to heal, so it did set me back some. These are the things you need to discuss with your surgeon. PT is very painful for me, and I can't wait until I'm done with it. Yet, other patients have done much better than I have. I can't tell you to go ahead and do it. You need to take into account everything people have told you about the surgery and the recovery. The ankle is the hardest joint replacement surgery to recover from. I will definitely keep in touch with you. My next appointment with my surgeon is May 20th. I should know more about my recovery then and will share it with you."
"Did you open the private message I sent you after we talked on here several days ago with my phone number."
"You may remember that I offered to discuss your concerns directly with you on the phone but I've not heard anything further from you."
"I had a very sucessful THR twenty one years ago and a revision last year so would be able to talk from a position of someone who had had two successful outcomes."
"At this moment I'm walking unaided following a very major revision of a total ankle revision eight weeks ago and am doing extremely well."
"My offer to talk on the phone is available to anyone interested however I do expect you to ring me rather than me having to pick up the tab for the call. Just send me a message and I will give you my phone number. It is down to you."
"Cheers Richard"
"Cheers Richard"
"Oops, I may have got you mixed up with someone on the hip replacement forum and if so my apologies!"
"My offer still stands as I had a badly executed TAR five years ago which was revised by a different surgeon with a special revision prosthesis eight weeks ago involving a six hour surgery."
"For anyone considering a TAR PLEASE do not have it done by anyone other than a surgeon with a lot of experience of this surgery and who can back it up with good outcome evidence. The risks of failure at some point are too high. Mine did not show problems until my four year annual check up!"
"Cheers Richard"
"Fellow TAR recipients: Not to minimize the very real suffering that many people describe after TAR, and to let you know that TAR surgery is negative for everyone, I will briefly offer you my story. for those of you who have already read my story from my previous posts, I apologize. Again, I do not mean to minimized the very real problems that many of the people on this blog and many others not on the blog have experienced post TAR."
"I am 71 years old and live in the Syracuse, NY area. I had a total right knee replacement in 2011, which I did well with. I am 18 months out from right TAR with STAR with subtalar fusion by Dr Sam Flemister in Rochester, NY. My only complication was entrapment of the flexor hallicus longus tendon which caused my right great toe to be in an almost 90 degree flexion, resulting in severe pain in the MP joint of the right great toe. My surgeon corrected this by cutting the FHL 4 months ago, which resolved the problem. I still get some pain in the right ankle, and particularly from the subtalar fusion, if I overdo on a treadmill, but can enjoy a workout on my elliptical. Overall am very satisfied."
"I had my left TAR with STAR 6 months ago, and am doing well except for Achilles pain/tendinitis, which I am managing with frequent icing and stretching."
"Overall, I am very satisfied with how I am doing from my ankle surgeries. To give you a glimpse of my lifestyle since surgery, In Feb to April 2018, 10 weeks after my left TAR, my wife and I were able to take a two month 6,500 mile cross country trip in a van from San Francisco to Syracuse, NY, staying in many campgrounds and national parks. I could not walk or hike the way I would have liked, but did not expect to that early out from surgery, and had much less pain that I did when we drove 2 months/6,500 miles in the fall of 2017 from Syracuse to San Francisco before my left TAR. I was in agony before each of my TAR's and could hardly take a step."
"I currently am able to play golf several times per week, maintaining a single digit handicap, mow my lawn with a riding mower, drive my tractor, manage a 120' X 60' vegetable garden, drive my manual transmission car, and just got back from summarizing my 40' sailboat on Lake Ontario, including 2 hours of deck cleaning as well as putting on the sails with the help of my wife. Although I am retired, I still work per diem 1-2 days per week at a job which requires 6-13 hours long shifts, but no manual labor other than frequent short walks around the workplace. Although I still have significant limitations from my feet and ankles, it is a far cry from the severe pain I experienced prior to the TAR's. My greatest current limitation is my right knee which unfortunately needs to be replaced."
"Like everyone else has stated here, it is important to choose a surgeon carefully, because TAR is much more precise and intricate than hips and knees. Seek multiple opinions, and be sure the surgeon you choose has performed a lot of these. Exercise to the limit of your tolerance pre-op so you are in the best physical condition you can be, and resume that as soon as your surgeon gives you the green light. During your post-op period, before you are allowed to start ambulation, keep your leg elevated all the time as high as you can, and ice pack every 3-4 hours, and exercise your legs while lying on your back. I found bicycle motion exercise is doable while wearing a cast or boot."
"One other specific piece of advice I feel strongly about, which I have not seen addressed by anyone else on this blog, is to not let anyone give you a steroid shot in the ankle. Although a lot of surgeons give these shots to hold people over to delay surgery, there is a US national recommendation that these are not indicated for ankles. My personal experience was that a different surgeon gave me a series of 4 injections over about a year and a half prior to my right TAR, and I am convinced that the steroids destroyed my right ankle. The xrays performed just prior to my right TAR surgery 11/2016 were dramatically worse, like night and day, than the xrays performed 11/2015. After one year, I went from significant tibial/talar arthritis with some remaining joint space to very severe arthritis with no joint space at all."

"I had ankle replacement surgery 4 months ago. I am still having pain and swelling anytime I weight bear. This is the same pain and swelling I had prior to the surgery. It really isn't any better. I am 47 years old and I use a knee scooter to move around work as a medical secretary at the hospital. If I need to grocery shop or go to Costco I must use my scooter. Twenty minutes in the grocery store without it has caused extreme pain and swelling lasting 3 plus days. I can't be the only one that still experiences the same pain and swelling prior to surgery. Is anyone else having the same trouble?"
"Hi Donna,"
"thanks for your reply. I don't qualify for PT but I looked up exercises online and have been doing them. This is my third ankle surgery in 2 years. I really believed the TAR would be the answer. I'm going to look into the shoes you mentioned. For me, staying off of it seems to be the key to being pain free, but how do you live your life doing nothing? Thanks for the tip,"
"Michelle"
"Hello, just to clarify a few things Salsagirl like it was explained to me. The swelling and pain may seem the same as prior but it is not. The pain is most likely from the bone fusing to the hardware and all those joints and ligaments that haven't been used for awhile. The swelling is just part of the whole experience and will get better over time. Do you wear support/compression socks? I highly recommend them and they do not have to be prescription or the really expensive ones. I bought the as seen on TV one's the copper that Brett Farve advertises and they work great. You need to be propping your leg way above your heart when you can, for as long as you can and you can wear the socks when you do this. I suggest you lay on the sofa and if you can put your leg up on the back of the sofa and prop it has high as you can tolerate it and leave it there. The more you use it the less the pain you will have. If you keep using that scooter you are going to get yourself so stiff you pretty much wasted your time with the surgery. I highly recommend joining a gym that has a heated pool if possible. That was just added to my PT 3 weeks ago and it has done me a world of good! You cannot just sit around and baby it, trust me I've been there. Taking it easy because of the swelling and pain will continue to set you back. Keep sneakers on as much as you can and try not to be walking around the house barefoot because I know that hurts like hell! You can ice it several times a day for the swelling as well. Whatever you do be mindful of keeping that foot straight when you walk. if you are pointing it out it can cause issues with the implant and also cause even more swelling and pain. Do you have all of the feeling back in your toes, feet and leg? Have you discussed this with your surgeon? I am a little over 4.5 months out from my surgery and I was bone on bone arthritis for 22 years with very limited flexibility and mobility. My toes are still asleep and most of my lower leg has not woken yet either. There are parts of my foot and ankle that have some sensation but are not fully awake. I wasted my time with a PT that had no clue what he was doing and after 24 visits he discharged me and I basically had to start all over again with someone new. There is something about the water that helped me the very first day. I could wiggle my toes back and forth and actually feel the floor. I have pain, I walk with a limp, and I want to scream most days but then I think about why I had the surgery. I cannot give up and I must keep working to get better! I wish you luck and feel free to write me back!"
"hahaha so sorry for this very late response! i havent visited the site in quite a while and just saw your response. I dont live my life doing nothing-smiling- I'm now about a year and a half out from my replacement surgery. I STILL have some pain (on busy/bad weather days) and some swelling on most every day but I've learned to live with it. I work full time (45+ hours a week) as a nanny to a family of 4 with 2 small boys that are 2 & 3 years old. They keep me moving from the minute I get there until the minute I leave. I also have 3 kids in college and a 70 pound puppy at home who loves to romp. I decided about a year into this thing that I wasnt going to let this thing stop me from doing the things I needed/wanted to do. up until about 2 months ago I wore tennis shoes all day every day 7 days a week 6am til bedtime. Since the warmer weather hit here in North Carolina I decided to try sandals and found that Tevas and KEENS have just the right amount of support and adjustability in their straps for getting off and on and swelling issues. This kills me because I used to be a shoe fanatic, but, so be it. I lost the use of the big toe on that foot so flip flops are out. I can fee it, it has feeling in it, it just doesnt work anymore. I also take an aqua zumba class once a week which has helped, and I've shed 60 pounds which I know has also contributed to helping out with mobility although I still could use to lose about 30 more. I cannot run, I cannot walk on sideways inclines due to my previous fusion, I have to be very careful walking in creeks and rivers where there are slippery surfaces, no trampolines or bouncy houses, but other than that I'm game to try most anything. I have stopped taking all pain meds unless I have an absolutely horrible terrible day and then I take one tramadol at night. I have been researching CBD products but have not bitten the proverbial bullet on that one yet. we will see hope tour journey has gotten better. It is definately a long slow one for many of us, and I still see improvements in myself even this late in the game. fingers crossed that they keep on coming"

"Thanks for your positive review. I am scheduled for a Zimmer TAR in August in Rochester with Dr. Luke Loveys. Dr. Flemister gave a second opinion and concurred, bone on bone pain; surgery only option. Both surgeons are highly respected, although no one in this area has performed more than 30 ankle replacements. I've survived this long with three cortisone injections. Am a 70 year old active female and am looking forward to resolving the pain and doing the things I enjoy and working two days a week. How many PT sessions did you have (approximate). Seems we'll have a $40 copay each visit!"
"Dear Irishjig"
"I don't want to worry you but thirty ankle replacement is really not many and one has to consider over what time span and was this using the Zimmer or what? I hear alarm bells ringing quite loud."
"It is essential to really know before you commit to the surgery this and what the outcomes were."
"I'm speaking as someone whose surgery was done by a very nice surgeon who had done about twenty-five TARs all of the same design over a shirt time span."
"I made a very fast recovery but it failed after five years and the problems a very experienced ankle revision surgeon had in taking out the original prosthesis and putting in a special revision prosthesis was considerable with my surgery taking six hours. Thankfully I seem to be making am excellent recovery."
"Please learn from what I've had to deal with."
"All the best Richard"
"I found Dr Flemister very good to work with. When I had issues, he was very responsive and very receptive to reviewing literature I came up with on my Medline searches regarding my right FHL issues. Also, before my 2016 right TAR, there was a question of whether or not I needed a subtalar fusion. I had received different opinions on this. A doctor in Syracuse never even considered that my 3+ years of disabling heel pain was anything more than plantar fasciitis and just wanted to give me shots. I did not think I had plantar fasciitis and did not want shots (the treatment is stretching anyway). Dr Flemister carefully examined me and agreed with me that I did not have plantar fasciitis, but had subtalar arthritis causing my heel pain, Dr F then recommended subtalar fusion as a solution for the heel pain. I sought opinion from Dr DiGiovanna at Mass General who advised against it. Dr Flemister was very willing to call me when I was in Boston to discuss this, and then discuss it with Dr DiGiovanna as well. At that point we decided to not do it. However, over the next few weeks it became very clear to me that I did need the subtalar fusion, and Dr Flemister got me right in to examine me again, and agreed. I am glad I had the subtalar fusion on the right, because that was where a lot of my pain was coming from. Conversely, I did not need subtalar fusion on the left side in 2017, and Dr Flemister agreed with me. I can't say enough about him because he would invariably answer my portal messages personally the same day, and gave me his cell number to text him if I needed to, which I only used a few times. He called me at home post op without any request from me."
"I believe Dr Flemister has done more then 30 TAR's. 2 years ago he had told me he had done 40-50, and I believe he has done quite a few since then. I know he has done at least 2 . I initially saw Dr Judy Baumhauer at Strong Memorial, who is past president of the national Association of Foot and Ankle surgeons. She has a lot of experience, but told me that she was doing more research than surgery lately, and referred me to Dr Flemister for the surgery. I liked Dr Baumhauer a lot as well."
"He did not have me do any PT with either of my TAR's, but he knew that I already had a well established exercise program with equipment at home. This worked well for me. I am not sure PT would have done much differently for me."
"PS: I just finished my daily workout in my gym and feel pretty well today."
"I'm six months out from my TAR and I'm still in PT two times per weeks ($35 co-pay). The PT is finally starting to pay dividends, along with other forms of moderate exercise. Remember that your ankle joint hasn't functioned properly in years (most likely). So, all the ligaments, tendons, and muscles have atrophied a little and/or haven't been moving in the proper manner. You body will need time to stretch and strengthen all those soft tissues. In my case, I am finally getting some strength back in my calf muscles. And, while I've had tightness and pain in my Peroneus tendon, probably due to lesions/ scar tissue, that problem is slowly getting better due to constant work by my physical therapist. So, stay the course."
"Actually, I mis-spoke, sort of. I have not done PT until now, but I am having problems with my left Achilles related to my left TAR done 6 months ago and am going to start PT since I can't resolve the issue on my own."
"Drs. Baumhauer and Flemister are great; I originally started trying to see Dr. B who referred me to Dr. F. Dr. Loveys set my leg when I originally broke my fibula in 2003. Dr. F told me in March that he's done 30 TARs, so he has more experience than anyone else in our area. Appreciate your experience and knowledge. I'm encouraged about less PT...we have an eliptical here at home and that's my go to exercise (and kayaking). I've been holding back on the eliptical lately knowing I have to wait until August for surgery - not sure I could manage my part time job if the cortisone wears off prior to August. I find the eliptical builds up the muscles around my ankle, so maybe I should wing it and be in good shape prior to the surgery. Thanks."

"I suffered with severe heel pain as my first manifestation of the ankle arthritis when I was walking Oak Hill for 4 days during the 2013 PGA championship. I thought at first it was bad shoes. It didn't feel like plantar fasciitis. I didn't see anyone when it went away, but a year later started with ankle pain along with heel pain. It took a while to be properly diagnosed. The surgeon in Syracuse did not do much of an exam and just made the assumption that it was plantar fasciitis. Dr Flemister did a careful exam isolating each joint and pointed out on exam how he thought the heep pain was subtalar arthritis, and the xrays showed it pretty clearly."
"It sounds as if have done well. For me the replacement hip twenty one years ago, and then the TAR five years ago was like getting my life back. It was devastating then two years ago to be told that the TAR had all gone wrong due to osteolysis and that the prosthesis would have to be removed. I'm under a different much more skilled surgeon and had the new surgery in February and am making fantastic progress."
"All the best Richard"
"Which brand TAR do you have where and by who is it done?"
"to your previous TAR?"
"What TAR did you have the first time and which one do you have now?"
"of my choice."
"Unfortunately, living in the Netherlands it is not available and is not covert by the insurance."
"I still have to make a decision for myself but I am really happy for you."
"Hello Edmund"
"Thanks for asking. The quick answer is that my surgery taking six hours was very successful and was ten to eleven weeks ago."
"Three weeks ago I had the weight bearing cast removed and was put into an Aircast boot. Within a few days I was perfectly able to walk without any support but walking to the shops I put the boot on to protect the ankle."
"2.5 weeks ago I was cleared to drive on the basis of a video I made of me walking at couple of days out of the cast."
"My surgeon has advised that I use a light weight ankle strap for driving and walking and if walking for more than ten minutes at a stretch to use the Aircast boot."
"There is minimal discomfort, no swelling and my front and back movement is not yet quite as good as my good ankle but really not that far behind it. I've been instructed to not rotate the ankle for the moment though the surgeon tested the motion and it was excellent."
"Well there you are. My progress has stunned my surgeon and all around me, got a new girlfriend years younger than I am and we are making plans for the future so life is good.<vbg> I will be 77 this year."
"All the best, Richard"
"My apologies Edmund for missing out several points but if you Google yogesh total ankle replacement you will find answers in a short video showing me walking and running up and down stairs."
"I would say that my recovery is in many respects twice as quick as the first time but it was a far more demanding operation and I'm five hears older now. Cheers Richard"

"Irishjig you really need to be careful with who you choose. I almost made a bad mistake going with a young doctor (30) that had only fellowed with a great surgeon for a year just because I was desperate. I went out of area but still in-network for a surgeon that had performed over 350 replacements. I had bone on bone arthritis from an injury that was 22 years in the making. shots never worked for me. Swelling and pain went hand in hand for me. I could not do to much and was found disabled at a very young age of 25. I just had my surgery 5 months ago and at this point I am regretting it! I wish I would have just opted for the fussion. The main reason is simply because you cannot prepare yourself for this surgery. No matter how many people you talk to or ask or read about. Everybody is different and nobody reacts the same way. My foot and toes and lower leg are still asleep which drives me crazy every day around 5pm and I can't wait for bed time to get here so I don't have to deal with it, where other people are fine with that because maybe they do not have any pain anywhere else. I too have stiffness and pain just like before the surgery. The first 22 visits of PT were a complete waste of time because I used a therapist that I trusted but had no clue what he was dealing with when it came to an ankle replacement. So you need to make sure you find someone that has experience working with people that have had the surgery. My incision did not heal very well or in a timely manner either. So always listen to your surgeon, he knows best, or should know best and should steer you in the right direction. You must work hard with PT exercises. Once your incision heals I highly recommend you join a gym with a pool. You can look up exercises on youtube to do in the water that will help your PT along. I'm not talking swimming at all. Just simply walking and side by side steps, etc. I wish you luck with whatever you choose to do! Just take your time and make sure it is what you want and you understand everything. At this time my surgeon is worried I may have an impingement or even new bone growth but have new plan of action either way. Good Luck!!!"
"While I'm considering a TAR, my surgeon wanted me to wait 6 months, reason to be determined."
"A brief history, motorcycle accident, almost lost my foot 19 years ago, now 71yo male, screws, plates blah blah blah, avoided having the ankle fused so put up with the pain of arthritis. Then a friend told me about CBD cream and I figured what the hey, may beat taking Aleve. Ok the stuff WORKS, no Aleve for over a month, no pain at night so I can sleep. I'm mentioning this because folks may find that CBD cream MAY help. Oh, I'm using it between 1 - 2 times a day, depending upon pain level and activity."
"I want to thank you all for your information and hope you all do well."
"im curious what strength CBD cream you are using?"
"Im also using a CBD roll on stick 500mg. it has been helping me also. I must say however give it 6 weeks using it 4 times a day at first before giving up on it. It seems to do nothing at first but I was told to stick with it for a month, glad I did. It has helped me significantly."
"1000mg, 2 - 4x a day, I miss typed sorry. I got it off of Amazon, I'm not sure it's as potent at the stuff I got from a friend but it sure as heck smells better. I don't slather it on, just some nice dabs around the joint then massage it in for a good 2 minutes. 2 oz lasts about a month."
"I talked to my Dr. today he strongly suggested I don't do anything until it gets really bad. It seems that the designers of the implants haven't figured out how to replace the plastic, pretty sure they use delron but....I'd love to see one, for the life of me I can't see why they can't make the wearable parts replaceable. He uses the Salto and the delron appears to be replaceable hmmmmm."
"I had a TAR on 25th Jan 2019 After just over 2 months I have good mobility but a massive amount of nerve pain in the top of my foot and a constant dull ache in the joint itself."
"Actually starting to wish I'd never bothered now unless anyone here has any suggestions espescially regarding the nerve pain,"
"Rgds"
"PETER GRANT"
"Jan 2018 right ankle replaced only pain encountered was very bad nerve pain on top of foot that has to this day still remained troublesome. Feeling just isn't right, but ankle is fine a year plus later."
"March 2019 left ankle replaced. so far the only issue is extrem boredom waiting to have cast removed and start therapy. 100% better operation results so far. Minimal nerve pain and no pain meds required at all."
"I couldnt find anyone else that had nerve damage to extent I did on first ankle, but stick it out with therapy and I hope you improve as I eventually did."
"Over all best thing i could have done as i still enjoy long walks and hikes in the mountains."
"Be well,"
"Kenn"
"Excellent news. Kenneth. Was it the same prosthesis both times? I had a TAR in 2012 but due to problems found an excellent revision surgeon who removed the original prosthesis and repaired all the damage caused by bad placement and installed an advanced replacement in Feb last year in a six hour operation."
"I have fantastic movement and can do six mile walks at a fast pace without. stopping and swim about half a mile daily."
"Everyone who has had a TAR should be aware and remind their surgeon to check at every. check-up for Osteolysis. This is what caused most of my issues and is a big danger especially with a TAR."
"Good luck, Richard"
"great surgeon (P.Fortin) and yes same for both. Thanks for the tip and great hearing about your positive outcome."
"Be well."
"Hi Peter"
"I had the TAR Feb 2018 I did great for two months after the cast came off and on my 20th visit of PT which would have been my last, something popped on the treadmill and i had a pain that never went away. i had bad nerve pain in my toes, and no other feeling but total numbness. my foot felt as if it were being strangled 24/7 it drove me crazy. The pain in my ankle was so bad i was actually worse off then i was before surgery and spent the rest if the year depressed and disabled for the TAR failure. having been born with a club foot and numerous surgeries all i ever wanted was to be as "" normal"" as possible and rejected all talks of amputation and fusion, soon after i deeply regretted my decision.. While all the surgeons i have spoke to preferences amputation it was never s"
"cont to peter amputation never something i gave thought to. Less then one year later went back in for the ankle fusion. though i am still in the recovery aspect and 2 months in i can honestly say i have no nerve pain, have feeling in my foot and toes and no longer feel like my foot is being strangled. maybe too soon to have a final answer as to whether this helped my ankle or not i honestly believe i should have chosen this fusion first and been back to my life a l"

"Can you tell us what brand of TAR you had and what you have now."
"Where ( which country ) is this operation done?"
"Thanks"
"The original prosthesis was the Zenith and for my revision the prosthesis used was the Wright Invision. prosthesis."
"My original surgery was carried out in Wales in the UK and the revision was carried out at the Royal National Orthopedic hospital at Stanmore, Middlesex UK."
"Please be VERY aware that it is essential that you choose a surgeon based only on their results and not if you like them or not. Your surgeon will normally make the choice of prosthesis based on what should be best for you and which they are happiest. with using."
"You can see a short video of my walking and running up and down stairs after twenty weeks following my original. TAR. Google yogesh total ankle replacement. kenward. Hope. you find it helpful. Cheers Richard"
"Please be aware that certainly here in the UK many of the total ankle replacements are carried out by surgeons who have done very few ankle replacements so the risk to you is high. It is a very technically challenging surgery and the recovery can be too!"
"My surgeon spends a lot of his time. revising the poor work of other surgeons. It is vastly preferable to have. the surgery done right in the first place. My revision took six hours to complete in theatre whereas a primary. should take about two hours."
"Cheers Richard"
"I had a TAR in July 2018. I have also felt this same nerve weirdness"
"Hi,"
"Sorry to hear that you are still suffering with symptoms similar to my own. My TAR was only 10 weeks ago and although I am still in pain and like you have pins and needles. However it is getting better slowly day by day though I do take painkillers most days and always at night, I would kill for a good nights sleep."
"All I can say to you is go see your doctor, you are NOT a whiner, get the ankle X-rayed there may be something may not be quite right. (emphasis on may). Take pain killers as needed but beware opiod addiction. I hav ebeen trying Comfry oil which seems to work, it is known as Knitbone and can be obtained from Amazon."
"Good luck I hope thing improve quickly for you."
"Regards"
"Peter"
"try adding CBD to your pain regimen. Rub it into your skin around the ankle 4x a day, 500 mg. Stick with it for 6 weeks. Dont stop, it may seem to be doing nothing at first. It helped me tremendously but I didn't think it was doing anything at first. Hope it helps you."
"Just an FYI on CBD, they don't list the amount of CBD/OZ. I've been using 1000mg/2x day for a non-TAR and it suffices with a bone spur and arthritis."
"Seems my Dr. doesn't want to do it until I'm too darn old to move or dead, which ever comes first. Oh Kaiser USA on Medicare."
"Upon looking at the design of most of the units I'm wondering WHY THE HECK?? I use to be in the fabrication/machining trades doing precision work and this stuff is a joke. Parts is parts, you have a base then you do a replacement of the attachments. The stuff I did withstood multiple G forces."
"i had a tar 5 years ago and suffer the same as you. Ive assumed its the way it is. Its certainly better then before. Maybe I should be stretching more. I should also lose a bit of weight. I understand not wanting to complain."
"can you please share which surgeon performed the revision surgery at RNOH? thank you"
"Andrew Goldberg carried out my surgery but he no longer does NHS work at the RNOH as I understand it. You can do an internet search to get his contact details. Nick Cullen at the RNOH saw me for my one year check up there."
"Good luck. Richard"
"We saw Dr. Goldberg at Wellington Health. We were disappointed in him actually. He did not review my husband's MRIs, and thus did not give us any specific information specific to his situation - just general information. This is AFTER his office refused to see us or even book an appointment unless we got MRIs. We spent over a month getting MRIs on the NHS, sent them to the office before the appointment and then he didn't even review them. He also didn't know that my husband was a hemophiliac even though this information was communicated to the office several times before the appointment."
"Dear Molly I'm sorry that you and your husband had a disappointing meeting with AG. I have found that it is often necessary to be quite pro active when interacting with the medical world!"
"Cheers, Richard"
"We were very proactive. We asked him twice to review them and he just waived us off and said he would look after the appointment."
"Dear Molly I'm very that you had such an unsatisfactory meeting. My experience seems to have been in marked contrast and the outcome has been excellent in every way."
"When I saw Mr Cullen for my one year check up at ten months he was amazed at my progress, range of motion, and recovery in every way and said that unless there was an unexpected issue he did not want to see me for my next scheduled appointment which was in twelve months time!"
"Please feel free to ask me anything you like and that goes for anyone here. Cheers, Richard"

"Sorry I don't know what type of TAR I had. It was carried out in Scotland this year late January."
"I developed a large 'fracture' blister which meant early removal of the plaster cast after only one week. I wore a 'moon' boot for the next three weeks but was able to remove that. Although I have good movement I am suffering from some joint pain a never ending dull ache. Worse than that though is the really bad nerve pain I have on the top of my foot. This is particularly bad at night when my foot feels as though it is burning."
"Id like to find a very experienced surgeon for my TAR. Ive been told an inbone TAR is the only thing that will hold because of cysts."
"Ive seen 4 doctors, but having done only 30 to 40 TARS, no inbone, leaves me lacking confidence it will be performed correctly."
"I live in the Scottsdale, Phoenix area. Sny recommendations?"
"Thanks"
"I cannot help feeling that this comment about cyts is very strange!"
"Cysts are caused by osteolysis and the reason for this happening is thought to be due to the creation of the microscopic wear debris of the components of the prosthesis adversely interacting with ones body. Some people I understand are more vulnerable than others and it has the potential with all joints, not just TARS."
"Perhaps it it the greater pressure with the TAR that makes it more of an issue but this is speculation on my part."
"As a result of the above I have to question to correctness of your doctor's statement."
"Cheers, Richard"
"These subchondral defects (sacs filled with fluid) first showed up in my MRI in 2015; which knocked out the Star TAR, so that an inbone Prophecy is the only one recommended for my ankle."

"Thank you."
"I had mine done with Dr Paul Fortin at Beaumont Hospital in Michigan 7 1/2 weeks ago. So far very pleased. I was able to talk to a patient of his from my community prior to having it done."
"i have the Inbome ankle implant the pain i have with it is threw the roof... swelling daily . two years and I'm looking forward to amputation ASAP. I would rather live without it than to live in hell with it!!"

"I wonder if your surgeon had not had the experience with inbone? For you, it is a moot point."
"Please let me know how you are doing."
"All the best."

"Hi All"
"Have been some time again since I had a look at this thread."
"I hope all is well with the 'TARS' and 'STARS' of this thread?."
"mike_49136 - I hear you where it comes to pain in an ankle....have closet full of T-shirts.. I have had a TAR for about four years now. Looking at your post really scares me a lot as I am sitting here right now with a hairline fracture of my Fibula..high abouve my TAR (foot in the Moon boot) due to misalignment of my TAR. Inevitably it is also a warning signal for me regarding the future of my TAR. I am also in a unfortunate position to have nothing left in my other ankle and I urgently need to get a fusion of that joint so that I can be ready when the times come for my TAR to collapse."
"That said, I honestly feel there is an alternative to amputation if you have a botched TAR. My story is somewhere on this thread on how I almost had my prosthesis removed as it was 'loose', according to a doctor here in South Africa. I refused at the last minute the operation and I have had mixed success with my TAR since then. It looks to be pretty fixed now, but it had moved and thus the alignment issues. It is much better than the pain I had before the TAR and I have a relatively good period now for few years."
"For you, who seems to be in the position where you don't have a prosthesis in your ankle, there is a procedure that was meant to be done on me whereby they fill the gap where the prosthesis came out with donor bone and then fixate the bottom leg - ankle part in a Taylor spacial frame for a prolonged period (9 months - a year). It's messy... I know, but there is a doctor here in South Africa who has done this operation with success in the past. I believe he pioneered it."
"Maybe you can also get someone to look into that procedure. If it's successful (and you still have your whits about you after 9 - 12 months in a frame😉), then you will have a pretty strong ankle fusion with no length problems to you leg etc. It's one hell of a recovery and one has to be very well prepared mentally for it as well, but it gives you a chance to have the continued usage of your leg ."
"If you want to find out more, please contact me (or moderators send him my email please) and I will give you the name of the doctor in South Africa etc. In the mean time, I will be hopping along happily...sort of."
"Keep well my friends."

"I had a TAR 7 1/2 weeks ago with a Wright Infinity and have been pretty pleased so far with the results. My ankle has been healing pretty good with little swelling then four days ago I spent more time on my feet and after had more pain with increased swelling (3+ edema) and I have been getting nerve pain and spasms in my ankle in the middle of the night every night since the swelling occurred. This morning the swelling is decreased to 2+ edema but I had the painful spasms approximately two hours after falling asleep last night. Does anyone else experience the painful spasms and what do you take for them if you have them? Otherwise I am doing great. I am 56 years old and had the surgery d/t arthritis. I am a nurse and my surgeon stated that I just wore my ankle out by being on my feet alot. I am planning on going back to work in two months."
"I wonder if you have tried to keep your feet above your heart and wrapped in very cold Ace bandages when you are able. to rest. I think you will find that this greatly helps. I also found that using the stretch stockings also helped me."
"Good luck . Richard"
"I seem to have lost my message I was typing to you. I have done all of these but the cold Ace bandages. Overall I cant complain and am happy I had it done. I start PT in a week. Thanks for your help."
"I've had both ankles done in the last 21 months (Wright Infinity) with the second five months ago. Better than expected results in both cases, but I'm still a little wabbly when first standing after #2. First one had a long period of spasms that made for weeks of sleep interuptions , but other than that it was/is just a matter of building strength and balance back up. Almost 69 and active as much as i was 15-20 years ago, but really wish I could jog/run. So far I'm 100% pleased with surgeon and unit. Be well."
"Thats great news Kenneth. May I ask who your surgeon was and which hospital."
"I had one done in 2012 but it was done badly and Osyerlysis set in and it was revised by a different surgeon in a different hospital and so far all brilliant."
"Please be aware that Osteolysis is one of the major reasons for a TAR failing and I strongly suggest that every check up you have that you ask your surgeon to check the Xrays for ANY hint of it!"
"Cheers, Richard"
"Surgeon was Paul Fortin out of Royal Oak Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, Michigan. Thank you for the tip (next check up is November). Be well."
"Thanks Kenneth. hope all goes well with your checkups. Richard"
"kenneth he was my surgeon also 7 1/2 weeks ago. So far I am pleased with the results and am walking short distances"
"that is great news!! I also wish I could run again but I'll take walking with little to no pain any day. I'm 56 and plan to return to work as a nurse in two months."
"I would like to estabish contact with anyone who has undergone ankle replacement surgery and reflect a ittle on the aftereffects and the longer term prognoses for recovery and mobility."
"Having undergone such an operation about 9 months ago I am currently coming to terms with a less than welcome (and certainly unexpected) imapct upon my life and mobility."
"Issues such as lack of mobility, excessive swelling and cronic pain from the ankle itself but also from the toes and lack of sensation and feeling in parts of the foot are those I am facing and would like to know how other poeple have fared, both in the short and longer term."

"sounds like the gp was at fault there. did you not have a follow up with consultant after 2 weeks? sounds awful im so sorry for your experience. did you have any steroid injections prior to replacement as they can increase your risk of infection. im trying to decide between replacement or fusion"
"I had a TAR and all seemed great for five years then it had to be pulled out due to osteolysis and poor workmanship. Found a top quality revision surgeon to do the rescue work. All going great at nearly two years thankfully. If going for a TAR make VERY sure that the surgeon is really experienced as so many especially in the UK are not! Cheers, Richard"
"do u mind telling me the name of the Rescue surgean. yes i have looking at national joint register"
"If you message me I can answer your question. Cheers, Richard"
"Deedles"
"no I did not have any steroid injections I had so many consultants while I was in hospital they would look at the wound and the pictures I had taken each week and with the look of belief but I guess they really couldn't speak badly about another physician I guess the biggest problem was I had faith in my doctor"
"I really do not understand why patients make a secret out of the names of incompetent physicians. The good and the bad should be known all of us."
"emileo4479"
"I am not trying to be secretive as I am not healed as of yet and really don,t want my comments to effect my healing with the other associates taking part in my recovery"
"I'm more than happy to share names and offered but no one has messaged me! Cheers, Richard"
"i messaged you. did u not recieve message ? 😃"
"No message received however I've sent you a message with the information you want. Cheers, Richard"
