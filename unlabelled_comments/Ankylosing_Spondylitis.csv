"Hi Jim
I dont know about Remecade. I am on Enbrel and Sulfasazadine. Only 2 weeks on Enbrel and feel pretty awful for 3 days after the 50 ml pencil injection and no change to the back and SI joint pain nor fatigue and headache and chest pain. Can you tell me about your experience with Enbrel? I have been told Humira is good? (by a Rheumotolgist) though Enbrel has less side effects. All the best.

"Never was on Enbrel. Tried Humera with disastrous results. Our bodies all react differently to the biological drugs out there. I was on Sulfasazadine about 12 years ago but built up an immunity to it. Next line of defense is methotrexate. After that an combination of methotrexate and biologicals. been on biologicals for ~12 years with methotrexate and occasionally have flare ups. Considered many times to switch to something else and one of my choices would (possibly) be Cosenoix. That's how this discussion originated: me asking about users of this drug.
The ONLY dislike for Remecade is the infusions every 7 weeks with the driving and 2.5 hour downtime.

"Thx Jim, sorry I misread that you had been on Enbrel. You are right it is difficult to find the right medication. I think part of it is understanding the progress of the disease and managing your lifestyle (and the pain) as well as a drug that helps with all that! So far neither NSAIDS Sulfasalazine and now Enbrel seem to have little benefit but maybe they are doing alot more than if I was on nothing at all! 12 years is a long time to be on Biologicals and I hope they continue to help you with minimal adverse effects (which ever it may be).

Kay, it is time for U to be on something more potent. Once the damage (fusing) is done you cannot turn the clock back. Me, I maintain my sanity/health by exercising daily: yoga, spinning, pilattes, sculpt and tone, hard bodies, etc. Have to watch my sugar intake...diffuclt to accomplish but the benefits outweigh the consequences. Rhume told me that remecade was the best treatment and so far she has been correct. I was in sulsafine for 2-3 years and it did seem to help for a spell, but my body developed an immunity to it and had to go with something more powerful which was methotrexate, and then combo of methotrexate and remecade. I am awaiting the comments from Cosentyx, as to my inquiry about how their drug works differently than remecade.
will keep in touch,

"Jim I agree with the exercise and diet. I have cut out Dairy and Gluten, ofcourse one gets xaught out every now and then when a restaurnat tells 'fib's' about what is in the food! And exercise too, I do my own physio at home, swim and walk (though that seems to hurt these days). Enjoy this and ambition is to do Yoga or Pilates. I am on Enbrel now.

"For me, change in weather (barometric pressure) will trigger it, possibly U 2. I need more sleep during those times, and I push myself less. Side/long term effects are there YES, but if U weigh your options you are still better with a biologic.
You have to think of who made up the side effects? probably attornys to protect the mother company. Crap, more people die from aspirin (and aspirin deritives) than car accidents. You do not see this kind of warnings on the aspirin bottles.
We just need to outlive to the day that they can solve this riddle that we have. Myself, I do not like being treated for the effects and not the cause either. We have about a handful of choices out there.

"Hi, I have recently been diagnosed after suffering with RA for 17 years. Would say I am chronic at the moment and so tired I just want to lie down and sleep but I know that's probably the worst thing I could do!! Due to start Cosentyx next week but concerned about side effects. Read on here that someone had to have their bowel removed after difficulties and they said they were sure the drug caused this, although medical professionals won't accept that.
My initial concern is lung problems as on Methotrexate I contacted Pneumonia. Scared in case I get the same problem.
Would really appreciate Consentyx feedback.

"I was diagnosed with AS over 7 years ago. I was treated with methotrexate and enbrel for a year or two with good results. When that stopped working, I continued methotrexate and added humira, this also helped for about a year. For the next 4 years I was treated with remicade and methotrexate. When the remicade stopped working, I was placed on methotrexate and consentyx. I have now been on consentyx for over 6 months and have had great results. I not only have symptoms in my spine, but also in my hands, shoulders, and Achilles tendons. I noticed lessening of all my symptoms within 2 months of starting the cosentyx and at this point, my AS is under the best control ever. I am hopeful that this will last longer than the other medications. I have not had any bad side effects from the cosentyx and it is so much more convenient (I self administer) versus needing to have a 3 hour infusion every 6 weeks. The cost has been completely covered so far between my insurance company and Novartis. If cosentyx is recommended for you, I highly recommend that you try it.

"Sorry to resurrect an old thread, but reading through this I was struck (and was worried by) the fact that these meds seem to have a fairly short efficacy lifespan. I had hoped these treatments, if tolerated, would be for life. If one is diagnosed in mid 30s or earlier, this means you might quickly cycle through these treatments before hitting your 50s.
I guess all the more reason to try and fight this with exercise and NSAIDs for as long as possible before moving onto anti-TNFs?
And let's hope Cosentyx is the answer to our prayers here.

"Hi sunlight,
I am new to this group and was diagnosed recently with AS. (Although, I have had symptoms that have gotten progressively worse the past few years.) Have you been taking anti-TNFs or do you use exercise and NSAIDs for AS? I felt like my rheumatologist was really trying to sell me on Humira but the possible risks seemed to great for me. I am trying an anti-inflammation diet and I know I need to get out more but I am soo tired all the time. If you have any suggestions about exercise, I would appreciate it. The pain and stiffness is awful but they say it gets better with movement? I'm not quite sure.

"Hi JZ...well, I haven't been diagnosed yet but will be amazed if I don't have AS. All the symptoms absolutely check out - lower back pain, migrating recently to the ribs and chest area. I'm waiting for a rheum appointment in the UK and have already had X-rays, which showed nothing.
I must say I'm not 100% sure about exercise. It seems to help in the moment of doing it, but sometimes the next day I've had pain (particularly if I've been exercising my chest). I'm going to investigate swimming as an option, which is apparently more gentle on the body. But generally I do it for my mental health, particularly cycling.
I would however say that stretching is essential. I find the UK's charity, NASS, useful for this. Below is a link to their stretching and exercise programme. One is an app you can download, the second is a book which I bought from their site and is a good guide.

"Hi Sunlight2, thank you so much for suggesting the NASS cite! What a great resource, I am going to look into purchasing one of their books.
And I hope for you that you don't have AS, but if you do I hope you are able to find the treatment that works best for you! I said the same thing before being officially diagnosed last month though - ""I will be surprised if my rheumatologist says I don't have AS."" Were you tested for the HLA B27 gene? Are you able to get an MRI? I have had both x-rays and MRI but the MRI picked up the fusion beginning in my neck.
Thank you for the resource. I have heard swimming is much better because it's gentler on the bones. I'm going to practice their stretches too.

"Hi JZ...I'm negative for HLA-B27 and my other bloods were also within normal ranges. Coupled with my X-Rays not showing anything maybe that makes me 'that' difficult person to diagnose. But I have an appt with a rheumy in February and hopefully that will lead to an MRI.
In addition, two other symptoms recently appeared: crepitus (crunching sound) in my neck, along with pain in my neck if I don't get my pillow height EXACTLY right. And a clicking in my right hip when I flex it above 90 degrees.
There are other things I don't have: no eye problems or heel pain; no shoulder pain or shooting pain in the legs or buttocks. So I'm grateful for that.
But the back pain is constant (Ibuprofen does dull it but it rarely goes completely) and the chest pain worries me the most.

The heel pain is one of the predecessors to AS not necessarily continuous.

Eye problems and heel pain come and go. But the back pain is constant. One thing I have noticed with AS is that when I was younger the pain was more in my lower back and then seemed to work it's way upwards and affect the peripheral joints as I got older.
Sciatic nerve pain was a big problem when I first developed symptoms. I hope you don't have it. It's a terrible disease

"Hi sunlight2, I have not been diagnosed AS just yet (I'm still waiting for MRI's) but I'm certain that will be the case. More than 3 months ago I started having back pain when waking up, which has been increasing (in soreness, regularity, duration and spread in location) and since a couple of weeks ago my symptoms are worsening fast. I actually have very similar symptoms to yours at the moment: I have crepitus in many joints, quite a lot of back pain (also significantly dulled by a NSAID: Vimovo), chest/ribs pain, and no eye problems or heel or shoulder pains (at least not yet). As opposed to you, though, I started having a little shooting pain down my leg a couple of days ago. Like you, I am negative for HLA-B27, got normal blood tests and x-rays aren't showing anything, Since our cases seem to be quite similar, I'd be very interested in knowing more about how you're getting on. Are your symptoms worsening fast? do you know whether people without HLA-B27 have a better or a worse AS? (according to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1079257/ it doesn't make it better or worse) May I ask, how old are you?
All the best...

"Hi marc...
No problem - although I really don't know much about AS I'm happy to share my experience. I'm 43 years old, so would be quite late to develop AS. I had my rheum appt and they have ordered an MRI. They also did some basic mobility tests such as the Modified Schober's Test. You can actually do them yourself at home with the help of another person.
These only form PART of the diagnostic toolkit. I was JUST within normal range for the Schober's test but my flexibility in the lower back is not great. I had done this at home so kind of already knew that. However after my friend had took my measurements I did the reverse and his flexibility was much better even though he's not very fit generally. So I do think again this points to an AS diagnosis on my part.
However in the last month I have to say my symptoms have eased a little. Perhaps I am having some temporary relief - I have heard AS can come and go in severity. It's still there, especially in the chest, but just not quite as strong.
Taking advantage of this feeling better I went for a short run (about 2 miles). And as I've often found, the next day this set me back a bit. The pain was much stronger than it had been. I do wonder about the notion that exercise helps AS...do people mean 'in that moment' or generally afterwards? Because I've often had pain in the subsequent days following exercise.
Still, I would say my pain has levelled out overall and is still a little less severe. I have not had any shooting pains in buttocks or legs, still.
As for whether negative B-27 indicates worse disease, I really don't know the answer to that. I have read in a study from the 80s that chest pain IS an indicator of more severe disease, but don't know if that still holds.
Let me know what happens and I hope you find some answers and relief soon .
Cheers.

new to the community here and definitely interested in hearing from anyone who has liked or disliked cosentyx. I am newly diagnosed, 24y/o female with no fusion yet but beginning stages in iliosacral. I am concerned with the malignancy risks of TNF inhibitors like simponi, enbryl, cimzia etc.
I am more optimistic about cosentyx due to its unique mechanism of action and pathway to reduce inflammation but it is so new to market in Canada and so not all aspects are as well studied.
I would definitely like to hear from anyone with first hand experience as I will be deciding on a biologic treatment shortly.
