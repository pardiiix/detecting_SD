"I did have this happen to me also - postmenopausal bleeding - only a bit earlier (that is, a year and a half after no periods). I could not attribute it to any particular changes (e.g., slimming, stress) and was frightened. Saw my family doc asap. He ordered a transvaginal ultrasound and I think I also had a smear. All was normal. You certainly should report this to your doctor, though - standard orders for any such bleeding. Call today.

"I am so glad to have found this forum. Suddenly had a period (very slight) after a 13 month period. I was not surprised to see it as two weeks prior had some signs that I was ovulating. But on being advised by a friend to see a doctor I googled post menopausal bleeding and was scared to death with what I read about it possibly being signs of cancer. I didn't sleep last night as a result and will certainly get it checked out by the Doctor but I feel loads better to read that it seems to happen to quite a lot of women. Fingers crossed that everything is normal. But thanks everyone for sharing.

"Sorry - should clarify: it is important to report vaginal bleeding that occurs AFTER 12 months have passed without a period. You clearly fall within that guideline.

"Hi Jeanne, I know it has been a while now since you posted this, but I am experiencing the same thing I am 52 and 2 years without a period and I just finished a 5 days period. I was wondering when you dr checked you did he give you a blood test first and was your estrogen high?

"This also recently happened to me at the age of 53 and not having had any periods for 3 years. I had some breast tenderness a couple of days before and it was a text book period for me. I had an acute bout of stress 5-6 weeks before and wonder if this could have caused an increase in estrogen and kick started things. I have not had any levels checked but have been thoroughly checked out with a hysteroscopy and womb biopsies and all is fine. I am now 6 weeks on and have had no recurrence of the period. Just wanted to reassure you it can happen and probably does not get recognised or reported by the medical institutions but it is as well to get it checked out medically to be on the safe side.

"Hi
I’ve posted on this discussion but not had a reply, I had bleeding after being 23 months without periods, got sent for hystoscopy on 24th May and ultrasound, was told I a small cyst on an ovary and a small fibroid also thickened womb lining, took biopsy and said I’d get the results in two weeks. It’s the 9th July today and I’ve heard nothing despite making three calls to the hospital for an update and I even wrote a letter nearly two weeks ago asking why I hadn’t been informed and that it was quite stressful being left like this. I know that no news is good news but if they had said they’ll get back to me in about 6-10 weeks if it’s not a problem I wouldn’t have been so stressed. Even my doctor doesn’t know anything, I found out later that my womb thickness was 12mm ? That was on a letter they sent to my doctors about hrt but not mentioning anything about they findings of the biopsy. I even had a second bleed in the middle of all this which scaredy me even more. Touch wood not had a third one fingers crossed I don’t , all the pmt symptoms I had before the bleed like very painful breasts and tummy aches etc have gone so I’m thinking it was just like most of the women on here, but telling me They have found things and not telling me what that means is driving me mad.

"I'm so glad to have this thread! I'm 51 and had my last period 19months ago, about 2 weeks ago I had breast tenderness and a couple of days of light spotting, I had just started some new hayfever meds including steroid nasal spray and assumed it was linked to that, so stopped taking them, then a couple days ago the breast tenderness started again, today I had period pains, and this evening have just started a proper period! 😯 I will ring the doctors in the morning, but was starting to panic until I saw the comments on here.

"Not sure if you are in the UK. My hysteroscopy and biopsy was on 5 June. I did not get the written result until 4 weeks later. The consultant said he would ring me on receipt of the results at about 10 days but did not do that. Fortunately I had spoken with my doctor (due to some continuing discomfort from the hysteroscopy) 10 days after the biopsy and they had the results which they were able to discuss and reassure. My womb lining was 4.6 mm (I believe the average womb lining is thicker when on HRT - I am not on HRT) and the visual result reported from the hysteroscopy was normal (although the doctor did mention a 4 cm cyst which the consultant did not mention at any time so I will follow that up with the doctors when I next need to see them). The letter from the consultant was very brief just basically saying nothing untoward and I have been discharged. It is very annoying especially if you are worrying getting a delay in the results and it is usually due to typing delays. I have read on the internet that it is more common getting bleeding on HRT and from reference to that in your post I presume you are on HRT. I did not get any oestrogen levels checked as this is not done and they are just keen to rule out any serious causes. I have read that stress can raise estrogen levels though and as it happened 5-6 weeks after some acute severe stress I am putting it down to that. Like you said, no news is good news and your results are hopefully just lying in a typing pile.

"Hi. You should share Imo... Usually when there is post menopause bleeding they do a biopsy right then and there, at least where I live, as there is a small percentage of women who have endometrial pre cancer or cancer so they want to rule it out. I would definitely ask GYN about this. I've had a biopsy, a hysteroscopy with biopsy and recently again a biopsy. Chances are very low but why risk?

"It is natural to worry about it. I am the world's worst worrier! You will see from my earlier post that I too had a 'period' almost to the day after not having any periods for 3 years. I had also had a period of acute stress 5-6 weeks previous to the period. Research on the internet does also provide some reassurance in that there has been a proven case of someone re-commencing periods due to stress and stress does seem to cause an increase of oestrogen (from what I could discover on the internet) which could in theory start a period. I did have pre-menstrual symptoms (breast discomfort) and my period was ""text-book"" for me. In the UK they do ultrasound scans (both stomach and vaginal) and whether they explore further by a hysteroscope/biopsies depends on the thickness of the womb lining. Was your measured and if so, was it below 4 cm and that should provide some reassurance. Maybe you could go back to your gynae to get some reassurance as to why no further tests were thought necessary as if your womb lining is very thin there is very low risk of anything untoward. If you look further into google there is quite a large percentage where no cause for the bleed is found (as in my case) but certainly in the UK the doctors are just concerned to rule out any cause needing treatment so do not investigate natural occurrences and I suppose only anecdotal evidence suggests this may happen. I do share your concerns though and you should speak again with your gynae to get more information/reassurance even if only to put your mind at rest. The question also is, what to do about contraception although when I mentioned this to my consultant he seemed amused and thought my eggs would be too old to lead to any pregnancy!

This third time, last time was one and a half years ago, my layer was very thin, no period symptoms like before, and she decided to do a biopsy even though she said she was very confident it was fine. For total piece of mind, so I said to go ahead. I agree with everything you said.

"NHS is the National Health Service in the UK. I live in the north east of England and they do referrals for post menopausal bleeding within 14 days (mine was 7 days later). They do tummy and vaginal scans and depending on the results, a hysteroscopy and two biopsies by a consultant at the hospital. All mine were done on the same day under a 'one-stop shop' type of scheme. I won't lie, the hysteroscope and biopsies were very uncomfortable and I would ask for some form of sedative or local anaesthetic first.

"Ana, I had two endometrial biopsies taken as part of the hysteroscopy. They were extremely painful. Not everyone suffers pain but many do. The nurses said I was being very brave as many scream the place down apparently. Anyone who is having an hysteroscopy or an endometrial biopsy should insist on some form of sedative or aenesthetic as there is no telling who are going to be the unlucky ones. That being said, my results were clear so please be assured the pain of the procedure has nothing to do with the results. I also nearly passed out after it but again this is not uncommon. I didn’t have back pain or headache after the procedure but I did have a specific area of discomfort in my upper abdomen area to the right which continued for two weeks after and also a brown discharge for ages after (I would say things are still not quite right and may yet take the antibiotics offered by the doctor in case of slight infection). Hope things go well today. Let us know how you get on.

"Please see my earlier threads. I had a 'period' almost three years to the day since my last one. I also had breast tenderness but in the three days immediately before and my period was a text-book period for me and lasted about 4 days. I have had none since. I had some acute anxiety about 5-6 weeks before. Given the breast tenderness it certainly sounds hormonal although it is essential to get things checked out to rule out other causes. I know it is scary but the doctors are there to check things out and treat before anything becomes serious so try to see the good in the investigations and be positive. I am a researching type of creature and a couple of websites you may find useful are www.avogel.co.uk[/b] - article ""Why your periods might suddenly come back"". See also www.dcurbanmom.com ""Rogue Ovulation"" after menopause? DC Urban Moms and Dads"" and also ""ncbi.nim.nib.gov which is the first documented case of ovulation in a post menopausal woman (proven due to hormonal testing). These may give you some comfort. Incidentally, have you changed your diet recently as improvements in diet can apparently cause hormonal variations as can stress. Hope this helps but please try not to worry too much in the meantime. Let us know how you get on.

"Hi, so glad I came across your post! I’m 56 and nearly 3 years after finishing periods I started bleeding heavily on Tuesday morning! I’ve had bad stress for about 12 months due to dad passing away and Work place not good.
I also had tender breasts and sore nipples and the then odd griping pain in my right groin a few weeks ago.
Since bleeding I’ve had terrible period pains and dull ache in pelvis and back. Feel nauseous too, bit like pregnancy sickness. Bleeding just easing off now. Did you have all those symptoms?
I went to AnE straight away and had cervical examination, all good. Now on urgent 2 week list for tests. So scared I can’t tell you

"Hi there ladies. I've just had the same experience myself!
I had a show last night I got a surprise, I haven't had a monty since 2012 April time it's now a few years later. I am just 51 last month. I rang my doctors today and they are sending me for an ultra sound just to check everything is alright. I've felt a bit bloated just feels like the old monthly returned! I have put on more weight, the right weight that I should have been before. I was under weight years before, due to a bad relationship I was in with my ex. But now it's a different story, and I'm a healthy weight now. But it seems that my periods have returned! Can someone explain if possible? Thanks x

"Hi elizabeth---I had a ultrasound and that came back normal. And I had a uterine biopsy and hysteorscopy last week. I am very very happy to report that just got of the phone with my gyno and biopsy came back normal too!!! Thank god. He also said if I have another period within a year don't call him. If I have another period after a year to call him and he will repeat tests. Basically he said that at 56 my uterus is tired and that this sometimes happens outside of the gold standard of one year to be considered menopausal. So for anyone out there who is hesitant on having any unusual bleeding checked out DON'T BE!!! The tests are a nuisance but nothing you can't handle just take a few ibuprofen before the biopsy cuz you cramp some. But no big deal. Better safe than sorry!!!!! Cheers to menopause!!

"Hi jeanne and to all othere visiting this forum. I found this forum after I had a full blown period 3 years and 4 months after my last one. I was in a complete panic as I knew it was abnormal bleeding. The worst thing was I was on holiday in Vietnam and couldn't find any sanitary protection anywhere so it was difficult to cope with. Anyway, I was reassured by this and other forums that although this needs to be investigated, it is quite common. A couple of weeks prior I felt that I was ovulating as I always used to experience mid- cycle pain. I had bloating and breast tenderness too just like I used to. I had a show just after we landed but didn't tell my husband as I didn't want to worry him. However, a week late I started bleeding again and it gradually increased until it was quite heavy. I had a lot of cramping and it lasted about 10 days altogether. Needless to say, it ruined the holiday as I was so worried I just wanted come home. My sister died last year from cancer so I feared the worst.
When I returned, I rang the doctor who referred me for tests. I was seen very quickly and first had an ulstrasound and internal ultrasound.Both of these were completely painless. A couple of days later I had to visit the gynaecology consultant who told me that the scans revealed fibroid change in my uterus which does not require any treatment and does not predispose my to cancer. I explained how I felt leading up to the bleeding and she agreed that it appears to be a hormonal surge. The consultant attempted to perform an uterine biopsy but was unable to open the cervix so was referred to the local hospital.
Just before my appontment, I came home from work early to shower before attending. A letter had arrived informing me that they had found something on my routine mammogram and had to attend three days later. I was in such a state as this was yet again another worry but it turned out to be a cyst also caused by hormonal changes. It was removed straight away. The doctor thinks both things are related.
I attended yesterday where a hysteroscopy was performed. I was in and out in about 15 minutes. I think the procedure itself took about 5 minutes. The consultant talked me through the process and althougn it did hurt a bit it was not as much as I thought it was going to. I took your advice and took some ibruprofen an hour before. She didn't carry out a biopsy as nothing was found (I was watching on the screen) so all was well.
I really want to reassure anyone in the same situation to seek medical advice as soon a possible. Apparently in 99% if cases nothing serious is found.
I am really one of those people who hates hospitals and anything associated with it such as tests but I can honestly say that everything that was done to me was OK. There really is nothing to worry about. I read posts on other forums that absolutely terrified me but if anyone readint this is really nervous then please tell the professionals who are carrying out the investigations. Everyone in my case were so lovely, kind and understanding.
I am so relieved that my nightmare is behind me after 5 weeks of worry and I can get on with my life.

"Hi Carole, So sorry it has taken a while to reply. I saw your message just before leaving for work this morning but I couldn't remember the password and have had to wait until getting back from work to reset it.
My heart went out to you because I remember so well how I felt when it happened to me. This website was my saviour. I thought the worst but when I saw how common this problem was I felt better.
It has been 8 months since it happened and touch wood, I have been absolutely fine since. The consultant told me that I was good for 6 months but if I experienced any further bleeding to go back.
Did you make the appointment? I suppose it depends where you live what tests and treatment you get. I live in England and the policy is to be seen within a week which I was. I would say they definitely will send you for the tests I had and if they don't they should. Ask for them. Even though this is a common occurence, it shouldn't be ignored. It appears that in most cases it is caused by hormonal changes. I haven't had any other unpleasand menopausal symptoms like the poor people posting on this site do so I suppose I am lucky.
Please let me know how you get on. I am with you on this.
Take care Julie

"Hi it started like that with me. Very light and pink. Then it gradually got heavier. It lasted 10 days. Got very heavy with clotting and very bad cramping just like it used to. That actually made me feel better as it was just like a normal period used to be for me. I didn't ring the doctor until I got back from holiday because I had no choice. Please ring today. Even if the bleeding stops now it is still bleeding and needs to be investigated. You will feel better after you have done it and you owe it to yourself and family. Honestly the tests are nothing. Nothing really more invasive than a smear. Trust me. Take care. Julie x

"Hi Carole,
Well done! You have made the right decision. I was really nervous ringing the doctor. We have a system where you book a telephone appointment so the doctor rings you back. I didn't even have to go to see her. I was referred to a Local Primary Care Centre where I had the tests described in my first message. It didn't hurt at all. Then I had to go a couple of days later for the results where they told me I ave a slight thickening of the uterus. I was so relieved. It was because of that I had to have the biopsy but she was unable to do it there so I had to go to the hospital. I was in and out in about half an hour. The consultant told me it was very common and only 1% is sinister but they have to make sure they find the 1%. I felt exactly like you and thought the worst and it was nothing. Read through all of the previous posts and you will find the same. Keep in touch.

"Hey Julie so glad to hear everything is okay and am glad to read that others are having the same troubles. I have not had a period in three years. Im 53 yrs young! Boom I had a period day before my bday Feb 1st!!! And now im laying in bed tonight March 1st and my ovaries are pinching hard! I had the sonogram and the probe. They said my uterus lining is a 9 1/2 should be 4 and under! Im having a biopsy March the 5th which is comming up Monday. Im really worried! Plus the fact my Momma passed away June 2017 with bone cancer. Can you tell me what they said your number was of your uterus lining? Im trying to think positive but it scares me since I have a 25 yr old handicap son who depends on me for everything!! But I do have lots of friends and of course my hubby who are willing to help if I have surgery.. I was just curious to know with giving you a clean bill of health, how thick or the # they gave you of your uterus? Thanks for forum ti speak out so boldly. Its not something i just openly talk about.

"Hi
I have now had my second 'period ' in 7 months after 18months. I had the tests last year after the first 1 and it appears I had a random period.
So do I go back now I've had second? I'm 56 in a couple of montns time.
I'm kinda not worried as I too had the hormone surge - sore boobs, overy pain and some itching! It just seems so odd to be having them.

"I am so relieved to have found this thread. I have had a period after around 2 years and my GP has referred me today for ultrasound to check it out. To be fair he did say that it was likely to be a surge of oestrogen enough just to cause a bleed but at 58 I was, and am, concerned of course. Thing is it felt before and during exactly as I always felt - even down to the PMT!!

There is nothing wrong. It's just the way the body is adjusting, to the absence again of not having your monthlys. But yes there can be symptoms of period pain, and PMT
Because I sometimes get that myself.
All to do with the body changes, in getting to the next stage of our lives.
But if there is pain, on intercourse, or unusual bleeds and heavy ones, and lots of headaches, then get checked out.
Otherwise paracetamol does the trick for me.

"Hi Vicki. When it happened to me I was 57 and had not had a period for 3 years and 4 months so was a complete surprise. It was a proper full blown heavy period - not just a show. It does appear to be a quite common occurrence, however any post menopausal bleeding should be investigated. My ultrasound and TVU showed a thickening of the uterine lining due to 'fibroid change'. I was told that is nothing to worry about and does not predispose me to cancer. The consultant told me that I was good for 6 months so if any bleeding within that time - not to worry but after that to go back. I think, after my experience, that it is just hormonal fluctuations that causes it.The strange thing with me is that my periods were very erratic and gradually stopped. I didn't have any menopausal symptoms at all - no hot flushes or anything. Since this happened 3 months ago, I have been having a lot of hot flushes, headaches, etc associated with menopause that I didn't have before.

"Hi there.
I had this myself. I went for a ultra scan, and they said that everything was fine.
At the end of the day, they said sometimes they can't explain why this happens, as long as all is well inside, then that's all that matters.
Only worry if you get pains, and unusual swellings.
Otherwise it's just the left overs that need to come out of our bodies. Everything takes time, to finish off.
Menopause lasts as long as your body says so. But my doctor said there is less chance of pregnancy, once you start missing your periods altogether. Less eggs are produced, and would not fertillize.
Buy on saying that, some women do fall pregnant, and there is no explanation, that can be given.
But it's highly unlikely that you would get pregnant without a period after two years.
By all means you can go and check that, you can get your hormone levels checked, they would tell you the answer.

I am to give comfort. And I'm glad that's what I did for you.
At the end of the day, we are all made the same. So there is not much to say otherwise really. But I love this website.
I have read so many comments about different things that I have experienced myself, with the change of life.
It's nice to know that we are all in the same boat, comfort for each other I'd say!
Don't have to run to our god all the time, when you can identify the symptoms from others on here.
Obviously anything that isn't normal, you would visit the GP.
But on the whole, it's been a great mind lifter for some things on here that I've defintley been able to relate to.

Let's be honest - historically we would have had multiple pregnancies and not triedto control our baby-producing and many women died young - and many had babies after 'the change' so they too must have been still producing the odd egg and having the odd period too but assumed it was normal (whatever that means!)

"Gosh! This is the first site I came across after googling my problem and you have already all put my mind at rest! My experience is very like julie's...though it has been 3 years and 9 months since my last period, which came one year after the previous one. Before that, they were extremely heavy for a few years but I thought I'd got off lightly as no other menopausal symptoms at all!! A couple weeks ago I noticed signs similar to those I used to get prior to a period, followed by very tender breasts just like I used to get in my 20s (PMT). Now this morning, I was freaked out to find that there is a little blood-coloured discharge. After almost 4 years I was stunned!! I rang my GP at once and got booked in for two weeks from now, then came home and googled this and found all your experiences - and whilst it looks like I'm heading for a few tests at least I am now reassured that this is relatively ""normal"", or at least normal for some women. I am just hoping I don't get heavy full-blown bleeds in the near future again...it's been so lovely to not have to worry about arranging swimming around my periods these last few years! Hopefully I will be in that 99% where there is nothing to worry about. I suspect from reading your replies, that mine might be down to fibroids, which I know I do have and have never bothered me although I have had them for about 12 years. I had thought about things such as a hormone surge but didn't think it could be possible so many years after the last period! but your various replies have set my mind at rest that there is probably very little to worry about. Btw I am almost 55 years old. I remember the date of my last period vividly (28th June 2011) as I had gone to visit friends in the USA for the first time and it was the most sweltering June over there that even they had experienced for many years - and I unexpectedly started one of my full-blown heavy ones the day we set off! - and I had to wear long black trousers and absolutely roasted! as I had nothing else with me except pale-coloured shorts and cut-offs. I also only managed one swim in my friend's pool before we left, as I couldn't swim for the first 3 or 4 days because of the bleed (

"Hi there. I'm glad you found this discussion, just as I did 5 weeks ago. My story is similar to yours - although my periods didn't stop until I was 55, 5 years ago. Up till then I'd had irregular heavy periods, then my last ""proper"" one was New Year's Day 2010 (the day after my daugter's wedding, which is why it was memorable!). Then nothing for 18 months, preceeded by tender breasts and spotty chin! I went to the docs after this ""mini"" period and although she thought it was a ""last hurrah"" she sent me for scans, which showed that everything was normal so that was that. Then about 6 weeks ago I developed tender breasts again, spots on the chin, etc so wasn't surprised when a week later when I noticed a brownish discharge. Although I didn't think it was serious, after a lot of Googling I decided to go to the docs again to make sure. She did a smear test (which was all clear, but I've been told it's my last one as I'm 60!), and sent me on the ""fast-track"" route to see a consultant within 2 weeks. This was a bit scary but she did say not to worry that it might be cancer because she was sure it was just an oestrogen surge. I had an appointment within 2 weeks, the consultant recommended scans and a hysteroscopy which I had within another 2 weeks. To be honest, after Googling hysteroscopy, that scared me more than anything else, but it was fine - no worse than a smear and the nurses were wonderful. They didn't think there was anything untoward, the womb lining was normal and there were no fibroids or polyps. A biopsy was taken, which I'm still waiting for the results of but I'm sure it'll be okay, and it was just a hormone surge. I haven't had very many menopause symptoms, the odd hot flush during the day and occasional mild night sweats but nothing too bad, and I've not wanted to take HRT. After reading all the replies on here I've been very comforted to realise that I'm not alone and there's always someone there who's had the same experience. So don't worry, get it checked out and you won't regret it. If you want to know any more about hysteroscopy just let me know. Take care.

"Hi Marie,
First, I'd like to say that I am so relieved to find this site! I am 55 and didn't have my period for 2 years and 4 months and then two weeks ago I felt the tenderness in my breast and on Monday of this week BAM cramps, bleeding, and pms! I was shocked and sad because I was SO happy not having to deal with this mess. The bleeding is exactly like my normal periods in the past. And since I am in between jobs with no medical benefits I am unable to go the doctor right now. I must say that I truly am relieved that it is associated with the hormonal changes with going to through menopause. I've had everything from the hot flashes, the moodiness, and the night sweats.
Thank you so much for sharing your experience, it has really made me understand that this is just one more change (perhaps a few more to come) that is necessary to get to the ALL GONE ALL DOINE stage of menopause. And just so that you know, I CAN'T WAIT! :D
Have a wonderful day and thanks again for the knowlege.
Best.

"Hi Suessun. I don't know if you have read my post from last August. I was told that I had to have a biopsy as I had a thickened lining of the womb but the consulant couldn't do it as the cervix wouldn't open. So I was sent to the hospital a few days later where the cervix was dilated using an instrument and the camera inserted. They insert the instrument to do the biopsy but in my case it wasn't necessary as the camera showed that everything was healthy. So if you have had the camera then it is no worse that that. I was in and out in about 20-30 minutes and I wasn't frightened at all. Just relax and hopefully it will be over soon and you will come out like I did feeling very relieved and reassured.

"Hi Heather
I only found this site on Thursday and wanted to reply to you as I had my hysteroscopy yesterday. I am 50 years old and had five days of light bleeding a couple of weeks ago. This was preceded by breast tenderness and period pain. My mother died of endometrial cancer so I was extremely worried and after researching every possible bit of information on the Internet I had diagnosed myself with the same! I had a transvaginal ultrasound which confirmed 5.4 mm thickness of the lining of the womb. This scared me even more because the cut off is 5 mm in postmenopausal women and anything greater than this increases your chances. I went for my hysteroscopy yesterday. I'm not going to lie, for me the procedure was extremely painful but was helped by the painkillers. The consultant told me that everything looked fine and that the lining was nice and thin! She was taken a smear and biopsy to be certain but has said she doesn't expect anything back. She has put my postmeopausal bleeding down to a normal period. The procedure took approximately 15 minutes, no more. The staff were excellent and there was a nurse holding my hand the whole time. If I was you I would ask my doctor for a 2 mg diazepam to calm you before the procedure. Good luck!

It's funny because mine felt completely hormonal too.

I also have one or two polyps which caused bleeding. I have to have an MRI. I'm hoping everything comes out ok. I am going to have a hysterectomy. Im scared! Is everything ok with you?

"Hi Debbie
Don't get too stressed about the blood test. It's generally not used as a cancer 'diagnosis'. It can be raised for many reasons apart from the dreaded 'big C' It sounds like he's just being very thourough. Let us know how you go

"Any forum where we can get together and share our knowledge based on experience, is a blessing. I have resumed my cycle after 9 months of nothing. This is the second month of what had become a normal cycle before it stopped. As I am very healthy and felt no different than usual, I have assumed that it was within ""normal"" for menopause(which covers as wide a range of possible symptoms as the uniqueness of each of us). It's nice to get confirmation from others though.
I have not been to a doctor for over 40 years and wonder at how quickly so many of us go and get prodded and poked and filled with the fear of possibilities,instead of trusting our own inate sence and the shared wisdom we hold.

"I was 57 a few weeks ago and im seeing my Dr tomorrow for what I think its Lichen Sclerosis of the Vulva so imagine my terror when a few days ago I had a bit of a pain in my left side followed by a dirty brown bloody discharge a few hours later. This is still on going and goes from dirty brown blood to fresh blood and its never more than a smudge. I have fibroids and I use a mirena coil to stop the severe bleeding that resulted in me needing blood transfusion about 7 years ago so I really dont know when I had my last period but I think it may have been about last april. Again it was just a smudge even though I used a tampon to deal with it. Im really scared. I neglect myself and I have all sorts of thoughts in my mind. My daughter offered to come with me tomorrow but Im going alone because she has a lot on her plate right now. Im scared.

"Thanks for asking Birdie, in my case, stage 1 endometrial cancer, this is the most common gynecological cancer, and if caught early has a good prognosis. I am just at the start of this journey, but I am hoping that the problem gets fixed (what else can I do?) To be honest, I'm not really shocked by the cancer since I have several conditions, PCOS, and Diabetes that are known factors in this sort of cancer.

the same thing happened to me last month ...i went to the doctors straight away and she refered me to gyne ..i got my appointment within a week ..i was so scared so i know how you feel
i had a camera were the specialist looked at my womb and ovaries ..i had a slight thickening of the womb so had to go back for another camera to look further into my womb
the nurses and doctors are amazing and ever so friendly
mine turned out to be the"" last hurrah"" ...i was so relieved and they said it is quite a common thing to happen post menopause. .but it always needs investigating
Good luck to you on your tests

And yes I am really panicing as I too googled it as I have not had a period since two years ago this coming August. What worries me is that before I stopped I had to go on mild hormone tablets to thin the lining of my womb and when that got sorted and I came off the tabs I have not had any more periods. I do suffer from panics as my friend died of cancer and I paniced as soon as i googled it so it is good to read that other people are the same as me. It is just all so scary.

"Hi I have been to see the consultant and have to have a hysteroscopy, the internal scan, and they then said that I have a thicker womb lining that I should have but that could be because I have just been bleeding and I also have a Polyp which they have taken away for a biopsy, I was a nervous wreck. All I can say to anyone is when they have a bleed after 12 months please go to see your GP and get a referral. A lot of the time it is just your ovaries kicking it for one final time - that's what the consultant said to me. Better to be checked and if there is anything catch it early. It's awful all of this. Oh for a world without cancer and fear of cancer eh! Wishing you all of the best.

If you feel really bad just ask for a second opinion or refer back to the first consultant and ask their secretary to ask why you have not had the biopsy just for your peace of mind. I always think dont worry if you feel silly asking coz its your health that counts and you have nothing to lose by asking. I feel the same as you very teary while I am awaiting the results of my MRI.

"Hi this happened to me.
I had an emergency ultra sound done last year. Everything was normal!
The ultrasound operator told me that he doesn't know why our bodies react this way.
Put it down to ageing of the body, and hormonal changes going on.
Think about it.. We go through enough with puberty, and worry with spots!
And then if our bodies are growing normal in our teen years!
Then it's like the body is reversing what it did when we were younger.
To age creeping up with us lol. Oh happy days !!! 😊👍

"Ladies, very happy to have found this discussion, your comments and experiences have been very reassuring. Same for me: 53 yo, haven't had a period for about 18 months. Last week, on vacay, met a familiar friend again. Light bleeding, didn't feel overly worried: in fact, it explained the surge of well-being I'd experienced about a week or two earlier (the meno ""fog"" had lifted, I felt normal again, felt a bit of libido return). But then I realized that post-menopausal bleeding is not normal. Will have it checked out by my GP, just to be safe.
Thanks again, ladies, for sharing.

"Hi everyone. I'm so relieved to hear that this is quite a common occurrence amongst us ladies. I was shocked to see my period after a year and a half of not seeing any, I am 47 ( early menopause runs in the family) , I have been feeling really grouchy and abnormally stressed for the past week and now I know why. Hormones! I went in for a full body CT/PET scan 2 weeks ago because I have a mole on my back that was tested positive for malignant melanoma (unrelated to my recent hormonal upsurges) the scan detects any sign of cancer through out the body and I'm happy to say that all the results came back clear. The report very reassuringly says that my uterus is very healthy. Because of this, I feel confident that I won't need to go for ultrasounds or other cancer checks. I will mention this episode to my doc when I see him later next week though and hopefully my health will continue to remain in good order, as well as all of you here.

To recap, I had bleeding 2 1/2 years after no period.
to investigate, i had 2 pelvic u/spounds (a month apart). It seemed that I might have endometrial hyperplasia.
Had a hysterectomy and D & C on mon - turns out it's a polyp causing the problem. Because of complications it couldn't be removed there and then - so am booked in for a hysterectomy in 3 weeks.
I'm happy with the outcome, that it's nothing worse.

"Hi there, just found you all today. I am 58 years old and getting fed up of having my period and all the ups and down and whatnots associated with it. I haven't had a period for 15 month thn started again in February this year, had none for 4 months then had it again for July and now August. Needless to say I am tired of the rollercoaster. I would like to have a hysterectomy done simply because emotionally I am at the end and experienceing menapausal symptoms on top of having to deal with periods sucks to say it bluntly. I had read various pros and cons and would like some input if possible from you guys here. I'd prefer a vaginal labroscopic procedure of course and that was suggested by a doctor since the recovery time is minmal. I have no fond attachments to my uterus or will feel less femimine. So rule out trauma of not feelinf feminine afterwards. Bascially I just want peace and be done with this. At my wits end.

"I realize this is over a year old, but it seems a lot of us google and find this thread. So I thought I'd share my experience in hopes of setting some minds at ease. I'm going to shorten this long story. I'm about 3 years post menopause and over the past 6 months, twice I have experienced the same symptoms I had when I ovulated. The first time, I had a regular period about two weeks later. The second time, it was just very small spotting. I've had 3 ultrasounds which showed a thin uterine lining, ovaries are fine but with small simple cysts. Bloodwork shows definite menopause. The second episode, I had a uterine biopsy. Don't let that scare you. No big deal. But it was also normal. The frustrating part is I kept trying to convice the nurse that the symptoms were like ovulation and she kept telling me basically that they weren't. Like I didn't know what I was talking about. When I finally talked to the doctor when i had the biopsy, she did believe me and said that even though the ovaries my not be producing estrogen anymore, we have other places in our bodies that do. So I must have had this excess estrogen produced and it caused my symptoms. As I googled for months for answers, it seems that this happens and most doctors just deny that it does. There is very little out there about it.
So if this has happened to you, definitely get it checked out, because we have to do that, but don't freak out like I did. And don't keep googling because you only find things that tell you postmenopausal bleeding is not normal and that's scary. I only wish I had talked to my doctor sooner rather than the nurse!

I'm 56 and post menopausal ...or so I thought; Now here I am with heated beanie bag on my stomach stressing about the period that I'm technically NOT suppose to have. No Period for 15 months until tonight and was well and truly ready to call an ambulance for emergency treatment!!
I'm not silly enough to replace this site with medical attention but it has calmed me enough to to get me through the night tonight until I see someone tomorrow. So I thank you ladies for being here before me and posting your experiences.
I used to get ovulation pain and I experienced it 2 weeks ago but I never connected it to that for obvious reasons. Since then the usual inconveniences have surfaced and I still never made the connection ...swollen stomach, breast pain and headaches, then tonight the period.
I moved to a regional seaside town recently and live alone. I don't know anyone to call ..my daughters father in law died yesterday, my girlfriend is holidaying in Italy, and another has court tomorrow morning and another has just had gall stone op ...... So again I thank you and will be off to the doctors in he morning

"Hi Rhonda, I do think you should call the doctor tomorrow but my opinion after going through this and doing a lot of research is that since you had those symptoms of ovulation a couple of weeks ago, then what's going on is hormonal. For me, it had been 2 -3 years since I had a period. My doc said I am definitely post menopause but that I must have had some estrogen released from somewhere else. I'm not so convinced but all my tests came out fine so I'm not worried anymore. But since you're just 15 months past your last period, I think you're just not in menopause as thought. The doctors say 1 year but our bodies don't know that! Stop googling. I did too much of that and made myself a wreck only to find out I'm fine. I do think that what the doctor will tell you tomorrow is to wait 2 weeks after the bleeding stops and then go in for an ultrasound. It's a long anxious wait, I know. I did it twice! But I really think you're fine and just having another period. I'm not just saying that to make you feel better. It's really what I think. I'm sorry you're alone there in your worry. Try not to. But please stop googling! It will have you convinced of all kinds of things that you need not worry about. I'm living proof!

I kept telling her that the symptoms I had were like ovulation but what she kept telling me was that they weren't. I KNEW what I was talking about! So I'd like to hear the rest of your story to see how it compares. No, this is not an emergency for you. They will probably have you wait two weeks and then come in for an ultrasound. It's totally painless and non-invasive. No big deal at all. And I'm sure, just like me, you will check out fine. It just tends to be a really long two weeks of waiting and I hated that I couldn't just go in that day and be done with it. Good luck. I don't think you have a thing to worry about.

"I'm 53 -- and not 100 percent sure how long it's been since my last period. I stopped keeping track of when it came back. I think it's been more than a year, but I wouldn't swear to that. I called and told them that I needed an appointment and just got my period and not sure if it's been a year or more since the last one. She gave me the next available appointment, which is November 10th. If I need to wait two weeks anyway, then I don't mind holding off until then. Although you say the ultrasound is nothing, I am the type that gets very worked up over every exam, appointment, etc. and I become very anxious.

"If it hasn't been a year or if it's around a year, then you're just still in peri. I went through a long time where I kept thinking it was over and then, nope! So they'll probably just talk to you in the doctor's office although they may do other tests. I know it's easy for me to say, but try not to worry. I think everything is fine and they may want to check to see if you're in menopause or not. Try to put it out of your mind for a couple of weeks.

"Thanks, Becky. The truth is, it could be a year, could be more... I really haven't kept track at all. know that sounds crazy, but I've had a lot of stress and issues this year at home and in my marriage. It's been horrible and I am even late going for my annual gyn exam. When I called today to make the appointment, they told me that I was last there 1/30/14. And, this week was the most stressful I've had and am even wondering if that has anything to do with this ""period.""

"Hi Becky,
It has indeed been a traumatic month for me. I did have the ultrasound and all the other relevent checks and tests and although my doctor is confident it was a hormone surge, she is schedualing me for a ct scan for everything female and bowel even though I am not symptomatic!
She undoubtely has me a little freaked about this but its precautionary as two aunties were diagnosed with bowel cancer after menopause.
So my saga continues at this stage.
Thank you for checking in on me I was going to drop you a line and thank you again for getting back to me when I was so very stressed and alone.

"I'm so glad you had the same outcome as I did. Since you had the signs of ovulation like I did, I was sure it would end up a hormone surge. I'm glad she wants you to have the ct scan but I feel confident that it's because of your family history and not the recent issues you had. I hope you can get that done quickly so you can stop worrying. And then this can all be behind you!

"I'm so glad I found this thread! (as many others have said) I'm 52 and have been period free for 2 years. A few weeks ago I had a very heavy discharge just like I used to when I would ovulate. I thought at the time how odd that was since I had the ultrasound to check on my ovaries about 6 months ago and they couldn't even find them. They said that was normal because they are supposed to shrivel up to next to nothing.
So yesterday I was in bed all day just feeling yucky, depressed, tired, dizzy, and naucious. I figured it was a bug. But sure enough just like clock work, a few weeks after what seemed like ovulating I get his with a normal, cramps included, perios!
I have been being screened every 6 months for the last few years because I have HPV and about 6 months ago had a biopsy because of some abnormal cells on my cervix. Everything has always come back normal and my doctor has assured me that the change in my cervix was just normal post menopausal changes. I'm really not worried because this is obviously a period. But it helped to read all your experiences. I would call and make an appointment with my doctor to have this checked but I lost my job a few weeks ago along with my insurance. And there is probably lies the cause of this. Stress and hormones!

"Thanks for the reply, Lesley. I would normally do that but I don't have insurance anymore. But I really don't think there's anything to worry about since I've been being checked every 6 months. Something would have to develop pretty quick. Since the odds are so low and I've been good about seeing my GYN twice a year AND don't have insurance, I think I'll be fine. If it gets heavy, lasts too long, or happens again I will check out the cost of local clinics.

"Just a quick follow up on my particular case. Mine lasted the usual time of a normal period for me, 5 days, and then stopped. All is fine now. I read somewhere that some women do this after menopause when they are stressed or something else causes a fluctuation in their hormone levels. This happened to me right after a very stressful couple of weeks and I lost my job on top of it, so it makes perfect sense.
Wishing everyone a healthy happy New Year!

I told him there was, my niece had just had a baby. He said that there are times that woman's hormones fluctuate which can cause a bleed after the menopause however they have to look at every case.

I have thickening of my womb lining (adenomyosis), 4 small fibroids and whilst under GA they removed a small polyp. Going to see the consultant tonight to see what next steps are but when I came out of surgery the consultant mentioned the word hysterectomy .

"Hi - first time visitor. Stumbled upon while also ""googling"" my issue which has fueled my paranoia. My story: 54 next month, approx. 20-24 mos no period and 3/9/16 BAM! wtf... 2 weeks leading up to it - typical symptoms (mucous), slight cramping, no breast sensitivity (active dancer; yes still at 53 J); threw/rotated hip possibly stress related (THAT’s for a different thread) and saw my chiro making it better thinking lower regional cramping was just soreness. OBGYN appt already scheduled last year for 4/14. Called in with symptoms-told to come in for Ultrasound (3/14); advised of a cyst on right ovary (could be from ""period""), but to keep my 4/14 appt unless Dr. called in a couple of days. 1 week goes by; heard nothing. I NEEDED to know so I called the Dr. office - the WORST bedside experience EVER. (held 30 min; hung up on. Called back; hold again) Dr. finally picked up and this is what I got: “Why are you calling, why did you need to come in, you weren't complaining about anything the last time I saw you” – a year ago for pelvic only; no pap..Really? Explained my situation as by then it was obvious she hadn’t even looked at the report, and continued with, “8.7mm thickening and some fibroids. Need to biopsy; no big deal I do it in the office and suction out some cells - take some ibuprofen before you get here.” Never mentioning the cyst, or giving me an opportunity to ask anything except, if I should I come in sooner and her reply )?), ""It's not going to change anything anyway-see you next month"" and hung up. So, today I found another Dr. and made an appointment for 1 day later (4/15). As soon as I get a copy of my Ultrasound I am reading that office the riot act, short of reporting her. I am scared/stressed to death and can't focus. It is somewhat of a relief to see this forum; but as we all know UNTIL we know it's a nightmare. Sorry for the rambling on - but I am just LIVID. thanks!

"I had been taking birth control until I ran out last July, the kind where you only get a period every three months. My doctor had suggested stopping the year before, so when the prescription ran out in July, right aroundy my 47th birthday, I stopped taking it. Didn't have another period afterwards. Went for my yearly exam in October, everything appeared to by fine.
Then right before Christmas there was some bleeding, not really a full blown period, but it lasted about 7 days. I didn't give it a lot of thought in the beginning, but after a few days I started wondering if it wasn't just a period after all. I've been having some back trouble for the last few months, which I had associated with some classes I was taking at the gym. Googling ""backache, menopause and bleeding"" is never a good idea.
I made a doctor's appointment for the following Saturday. The bleeding stopped, and I cancelled the appointment. Then a couple of weeks later I had some spotting, so I made another appointment. I went on Friday, and she says everything looks OK, but I will be having an ultrasound this week just to be sure. Of course, today it seems I've started yet another period.
It's scary, and frustrating. None of my relatives have had any reproductive cancers (that I know of), but my mother's parents both died of colon cancer, and her brother died of pancreatic cancer in his mid-50s. Any time I feel a bit off, my mind goes to cancer first. I'm a natural born worrier, and of course I've been worried sick for the last several weeks. My husband thankfully isn't a worrier, and is convinced everything will be fine. It's good that he's like that, it wouldn't be pleasant if we were both about to go off the deep end.

"This seems to be a very common thing and I am glad everyone here is taking it upon themselves to get checked out.. it is all very scary and stressfull but can be a life saver.... I posted on here last June I think it was...going through what everyone here is going through... that shock horror of the ""Period"" after menopause... for some the body is adjusting and for others it is a little warning that things may not be quite right.... so for all of you that have taken the first step of making the GP call ... well done !!!! For those that haven't, please do it is scary I know....but do it and follow through..... A quick re-cap from me... Last June I went to my Gyne with this problem... he examined me there and then and did an ultrasound followed by a trans vaginal scope... this picked up what looked like a cyst on my ovary...I was about 2 years post the big ""M"" so he refered it as a tumour which he said could be benign, but he would send me for an MRI... Well after a 10 long days of worry...I had my MRI which showed what could be a borderline ovarian tumour...but they couldn't find out exactly until they operated, so I was refered to a lovely surgeon who did a laparoscopy at the end of July (was in hospital 1 night..) the reports came back that it was indeed borderline... so because of my age 50 years and the fact that I had had the menopause a hysterectomy was advised.. In mid September I had the op... was in hosptal 6 nights.. all went well, got the pathology report back saying that they had found some borderline cells outside of the ovary and as I have had everything taken out, I am now having a course of 6 cycles of chemo, for preventative measures..Just ha my 4th ... My oncologist and Gyne said that the bleeding may or may not have had anything to do with this diagnosis... but by me acting on this and not ignoring it it caught things earlier..... I will have check ups and ongoing tests as these cells can turn into ovarian cancer at a later stage.. so once again it is more than likely that there is nothing to worry about... but one persons normal is not everyones normal and ovarian cancer doesn't always give symptoms... and believe me 7 months on I am so glad I made that phone call...so ladies isten to your gut feeling.... you will be scared and stressed... but that is normal... being prodded and poked is not nice, but for the medical team this is a job and it is normal.... my gyne said to me that he feels very privileiged that ladies come to him for help because he understands that it is a very hard thing for them to do... but he is there to help and re-assure and will do his up most to help.... I hope this helps..

"You said you do bleed a little right? If you're in perimenopause, periods can be heavy and then toward the end, they can be very light. My doctor told me to call if I completely missed 3 periods in a row. She would call in progesterone which would cause me to have a period. That went on for a couple of years.

Then by the grace of God I came across this forum and I am so relieved. I'm 47 years old and so I was happy and content not to have menstrual cycles anymore! Then it came flooding and with the flood came large clots that scared the bejeebees outta me. So, once again, thank you guys for helping me to get through this. I still have to go to the doctor even though I'm afraid to do that as well. But because of the posts that you guys made I'm going to put on my big-girl panties and go through with it.

Up until 5 months later. They're backkkkkk. Every 4 weeks. For up to 8 days. Most days aren't bad, but 2-3 are horrible. I now wish I hadn't stopped taking the pills. I went to the doctor after the first one started back in December. Did the ultrasound and everything. All normal. I dread that this could go on monthly for years yet.

"Hi
Just came back from the doctor. It's been 2 years and 2 months since my last period. So I was officially in menopause. As I had the usual vaginal discharges and soar boobs 2 weeks ago I was teed off at having a period. Wow. So depressing. As my mother had uterus cancer they sent me to a gynecologist. I will have a ultrasound done as well as blood tests. So I'm sure I'm fine.
The reason I am writing is this forum reassured me. When i started having the symptoms 2 weeks ago I googled it and it was fine. Once the bleeding started this week I googled again and it said to see a doctor. So I did. All is good. Unlike so many ladies in this site I wasn't and am not worried. Because I don't feel sick. I'm 55. All is good. These are the good years ladies. So let's enjoy. But I'm glad I had it checked out. Believe it or not I have not gone to a gynecologist in over 20 years. My youngest son is 21. So there has been no need. At any rate that was probably another reason why now I will have an appointment. It's been a while. I guess I get that. I don't like doctors. So there.
I will get back to this only if it's bad. But since all I have read in this site was nothing wrong with anyone. Chances are I will not come back. Just wanted to say thank you. It's been great and quite reassuring.
Have a great menopause ladies.

Went to the doctors and I'm due for a swab and blood test next week, they also booked me in for a scan.
I had something similar a few years ago but not like this, I also had a scan then and everything was fine so try not to worry.

I have been under a lot of stress and after reading all the responses here I do feel a bit better. I am going to try to get into a regular MD first which takes time but is needed to see a gynecologist I believe. My flow is light and woke me up this morning but reading online is so scary.

"I just had to pop in and say that I am forever grateful to you ladies. the whole rest of the Internet is bound and determined to scare us silly and you all are so reasonable. My periods stopped pretty early, but I was pretty heavy and they'd been so horrendous that I didn't really care. A few years in I had a light period and was referred to the GYN and underwent TVU and endometrial biopsy. The TVU revealed a large uterine fibroid. The next time it happened, a different GYN did TVU and opted to go ahead with an hysteroscpy and D&C, both of which were completely negative. He was an older doc and had the attitude that if you are finished using your uterus, you should have it all out. Worse, he wanted to do an abdominal surgery, so I moved on to another GYN the next time, who did all the same tests (TVU and endometrial biopsy) and determined that I had a big ol' fibroid.
So, in total, I have had three negative work ups for essentially what acts and feels like a normal period, crampy, backache, etc.
Two weeks ago I had a dream I was having a period and lo and behold it I didn't start with this very light pink show for a few days; then a few days later what felt and looked like a light period.
I have an appointment with a new PCP on Wednesday and I will go over all this with him, but honestly, given the fact that my last completely negative workup was not even 1-1/2 years ago, I have opted not to worry because I honestly just think that some of us are ""outliers"" from the ""norm"" because just look how many of us there are! I am grateful for your stories and thanks for letting me butt in and tell mine.

"Same thing happened to me! I was a nervous wreck for weeks. But that was over a year ago and all is fine and it hasn't happened since. My doctor said it was probably a surge of estrogen. She said our bodies continue to produce small amounts in other parts of our bodies and not the ovaries. Or it might have been a leftover egg that decided to drop. I was just frustrated that there's not any research on this even though it is fairly common. So I know you will worry but try not to keep searching online.

"I had all the symptoms I used to have during ovulation with the discharge and sore breasts about 2 weeks before. Then my period was what was normal for me before menopause. A little heavy for 3 days or so and then spotting for about 8 days. But that was typical for me. My ultrasound was two weeks later and the lining was normal. But I had stopped bleeding by then. I did have a biopsy as a precaution and it was normal. I have a friend who's lining was 11mm. She had a dnc and her results we're normal. So your thickened lining doesn't necessarily mean anything bad. In fact, the odds are it's fine. But you're doing the right thing having it checked. I know how traumatic this is for you.

Here is how my periods went when I thought I was through menopause Last period was March 20, 2013 went all the way without until February 2014 I started spotting so after the spotting in feb 2014 then I went without a period Till 2015 and started spotting for seven days then I made it till 2016 but this month 10 to 14 days before I started bleeding I had ovulated the egg white discharge then June 2 I started heavy bleeding! Is it possible I haven't reached true menopause yet even though I'm 59? I have never taken HRT. With every symptom makes me so nervous and scared out of my wits :-(

"Tuesday June 14th I had some bleeding that turned into totally disgusting almost black discharge. As of today, June 26, I am still having lite brown discharge. I am 18 months post menopausal. Called my GYN and had a ultrasound that Thuresdsy. Saw the GYN Friday morning and had a pelvic exam done. Other than Adenomiosis and a 3mm endometrium, the ultrasound found nothing. I was told to call her back if I was still experiencing the discharge Monday. I was, so I called the office and have a endometrial biopsy scheduled for this Tuesday. I have had two biopsies before. One was before a uterine ablation and the other before a d&c. Anyone else experience anything like this?

"Yes, I get on and off cramping and for a day I had lower back pain. I have also had pain on my right side but the ultrasound showed my ovary to be normal. If I would have had normal bleeding I would have thought it was a period but the discharge has really thrown me off. I did have the ablation because of heavy and long periods.

"I had a similar experience but mine was like a real period. That always ended in brown discharge though and did that time too. I was more than 2 years post menopause. Maybe even close to 3. My uterine lining was 3 mm and I had a cyst on my ovary. I had the biopsy and it was fine. That was over a year ago and no problems since. The biopsy is a precaution because the chance of an abnormal biopsy if your uterine lining is less than 5 mm is almost zero. The doctor said I probably had a surge of estrogen from somewhere other than my ovaries because my blood tests showed I was definitely in menopause so I didn't ovulate. She said we still produce estrogen in other parts of our bodies just in small amounts.

"I'm cool with the biopsy because I want piece of mind. My GYN thought it maybe stress related. I have only been with this GYN for two years. We moved and I had to replace the Dr. that deliver my four children, preformed the Ablation, and D&C. I was a little taken back when she asked me why I had the D&C. Seems to me she should have looked over my records before I had my appointment Friday. But what do I know.

"I had a D&C a little over a week ago for bleeding 2 1/2 yrs after menopause. Uterine lining was 9.3mms. Results? Normal. Not even hyperplasia. Gynie says I had an estrogen surge, probably from stress I had been experiencing. He said the adrenal glands also secrete a small amount of estrogen and when we're under a ton of stress, those glands kick out adrenalin, cortisol and estrogen. It was just enough to bring on a period. If it happens again soon, he'll do a 2 week course of progesterone to keep my high estrogen in balance.

"Mine did. I went in thinking I was having a consultation for a Uterine Ablation. When the nurse told me to go in the exam room I told her I was here for a consultation not an exam. She informed me that the Dr decided to do a biopsy instead. You will have to undress from the waist down. Then you will be asked to assume the position. Once you are ready they prep like your getting a Pap test. Some will spray your cervix with a numbing medicine. Open your cervix enough to put a pipeline thru to take a sample. It is not a pleasant experience. Some women find it painful and some don't. I would take 2 or 3 Motrin about 45 to 60 minutes before your appointment.

Mine was 9mm . The bleeding I was doing all month and the first 5 days of this month he said had stopped
He said he seen no blood when he was doing all that stuff down there. He said cercivc was closed and had to dilate it open some to get bisopies . When you all had this done did they go over about C and so forth ? Those test was NO picnic !!! They did urine test too .

"I forgot that he had trouble with the endometrial biopsy. The pap is fine. Easier to get that. I think his plan sounds good and thorough so stick with him. He may have only been there a year but that doesn't mean he isn't experienced. No need for another ultrasound. The tests he plans to do are appropriate so the ultrasound won't change that. Yes it's probable that the lining was thicker because you we're bleeding but he needs to do all the tests to see why that was happening. Hang in there. Hopefully all these tests will put your mind at ease.

"I just got back from my uterine biopsy. I can honestly say ""that sucked"". Makes me sorry I had two daughters. No one should have to go through that. I went from thinking it was over only to find out my cervix would not open, Dr having to use a special tool to open it, and then having the clamp fall off that was holding down my cervix. I swear all of the was 5 minutes. After breaking through my cervix I think she started looking for my tonsils. I almost passed out when she asked the nurse for another sample pipelle.
Hopefully everything will be alright. She's not sure if the sample will so anything. If the bleeding stops and the sample is clean I'm good. If the bleeding continues I will need a D&C. The results should be back in about a week.

"I don't know anything about what the care is like there so maybe knowing what should happen will help. For me, I had to wait 2 weeks after the period stopped and then go in for an ultrasound. I worried like crazy but it showed a very thin uterine lining and a cyst on my ovary. Nothing at all to worry about and they sent me home. That was a year and a half ago and no problems. But if they do an ultrasound while you're still bleeding, the uterine lining may be thick. But that would be normal if you're having an actual period. There are other tests they might do. But this seems to be fairly common. Don't let them scare you and don't start googling. There isn't much research on this and there should be.

"I just wanted to pop back onto the thread and update after my doctor's appointment yesterday. I met my new PCP and love him. He spent a good half an hour discussing things with me and I feel really great about switching my primary care to him. I also had to see him in order to get referrals to the GYN in place, but while we were discussing the fibroid issue and all of the previous extensive studies I have had on my uterus, I just came right out and asked if this occasional spotting was something that I needed to freak out about...and he said no and reaffirmed what my brain had been telling me...that if 1.5 years ago we were in there and we did X, Y and Z to rule out cancer, then if the same thing presented again in exactly the same way, then the likelihood it was anything different did not warrant me going to the ends of the Internet digging up information to terrorize myself.
So, here's what I think, though I'm no doctor and I am testimony that we should absolutely stay on top of our GYN care, BUT, as someone said down the thread, our bodies don't necessarily know what 12 months is and I think, obviously, some of us are shining examples of that.

"Barbara, please dont worry you didnt even go much over the 12 months norm. I was post menopause for 19 months spotted 7 days and then 9 months later had a flood of a period. I was scared out of my mind. I went to ER where they did an transvaginal ultr sound and my uterus lining showed 9mm thickness which threw my tormenting fear into overdrive. I had to have biposies done of the uterus and cervic plus pap snear ALL test results came back fine . I thank the Lord for that! I am 59 years old and thought I was way into post menopause BUT my blood work came back that I am still preimenopause! I was shocked , my gyn said our bodies do not know calendar or time. Please relax I'm sure you are fine and just maybe you are not menopause like you thought. I mean I went 19 months without one and ended up have two periods. The gyn said I will more than likely ovulate again and maybe have a few more years of this mess and like I said I am 59 years old! The Lord is with you and keep the faith!

"It's not cancer. Mine started back up in December after not having one for six months. It lasted for more than two weeks, first spotting for about a week, and then pretty heavy. I too was worried, went for an ultrasound. Nothing at all wrong. I've had periods every month since then (longer than normal, and often heavier than I usually had them), the last one was the lightest and back down to about 7 days about a month and a half ago. By my calendar, I should have started another 8/9, but haven't. I highly suspect there will be more, whether it's a week from now, a year from now, or three years from now. We were all under the illusion that it just stops, and never happens again, and it's simply untrue for many, many women. Probably for most women. I think it's just something people don't like to talk about.

"I just got back from the gyno. I am scheduled do,tan ultrasound tomorrow afternoon and the biopsy Tuesday morning. The doctor said this is not common which scared me. She did say my uterus was small which she said that if it is cancer, it is early 😓. Still so scared but so grateful to have found all of you. Everything else on the web has me a mess. I just keep praying.

Like Jacky said you was only 19 days over I would say you not even menopause like you thought :-) Ask your gyn to do blood work on your hormnones. It's like now our 12 months start all over. May I ask your age? Think postive the best you can and yes I know its hard but fear and torment is not good for our bosies or our hormones either.

"I'm going to have a glass of sangria myself! So anyway when she started she said I really can't tell anything without the pictures. The only way I would be able to tell is if the lining is really thin, but even if it's thick, it doesn't mean it's cancer.
So she started checking and said ""oh, now see, the lining is very thin and I see a follicle which I think is an. Egg trying to come down"" she said even if you get a bad cell with the biopsy which I don't. Think you will, you will be ok. She also said it's a hormonal surge so she took a blood test.
The best part......she said if she had a dime for every woman that came in bleeding after being without a period for more than a year, she would be a very rich woman!
So on to the biopsy on tuesday, and thanks to all of you, I can have a good weekend and. I hope all of you do too! Let's drink to that!

"your chances of C are very low. I read that with a thin lining it is about 0,1 % chance. And even if it was C, uterus comes out, as you found it early, and you are fine. Bleeding is an early sign. But you most very probably do NOT have C.

"Hi Barbara, I felt I had to reply to reassure you because my consultant told me it was very common for post menopausal bleeding to occur so verena is right, it is baloney!! It's true they have to discuss the fact it may be cancer as they have a duty to do that but I was reassured by two consultants that it is very common and not to go assuming the worst. I won't say don't worry because like all of us, you will but there are many reasons for bleeding after menopause, mine was my ovaries waking up again after a snooze!

"Hi Crosado8, I read your post and would really like to know what the doctors said the reason for your thickened lining is? I've just had a transvag ultasound and my lining is 10mm. I'm terrified and I can't stop crying. I'm having a biopsy on Monday and any polyps removed. I'm 52 and 14 months without periods until 2 weeks ago. Consultant wasn't particularly helpful and if it's not C I don't understand why the lining has thickened? Could it be ordinary periods again?

"Hello Jane,
YES it could just be a surge in hormones and after the period is shed the lining thins :-) thats what mine was. I was horrified to say the least when after 19 months of NO periods I wake up on June 2, 2016 with blood rushing out of me talk about scared (i'm 59) the second day I was rushed to ER because after filling bottom of toliet with blood I stood up and it was still pouring out of me (very heavy) My age, no periods for 19 months I was convinced of C.The fear was so strong I could hardly function. I went through all the test , smears, transvaginal ultra sound, biospies and maunal pelvic. My blood work came back that I was NOT menopause like I thought which was another shock. Thank God all my test results was good. I would say YOU too are FINE 10mm is not bad mine was 9mm. Plus you are only 52 and only went 14 months which is NOT a long time from your 12 months, the chief of gyn said the body does not know calendar or time. More than likely you too had a sugre in hormones which triggered the period. After your bleeding it goes down. Before you started the period did you notice any ovulation discharge before hand? How was your period, how long , how heavy? Did the bleeding stop? My gyn said when bleeding stops its a good thing. I bleed Heavy the first 4 days, then spotted the entire month of June and into the first week of July. What is happening to you is VERY common in menopause. Ask for blood work to you may see you NOT in total meno like you thought. What all symptoms are you dealling with or did when you had that period? Try not to let this scare you I know easier said then done but what you are going through is NOT so uncommon :-)

?What they don't tell you for some reason is that it is very common for this to happen. Although if you read the internet and listen to the doctors, all they talk about is C.

It is very unlikely it is C and I'm sure you are going to be fine....you just have to get through the waiting period...ugh!

Like you, I'm very frustrated that everything you read gives the impression that it is not at all common and makes you think the worst. It is never ever mentioned that it even happens at all. And the nurse at my doctors office gave me the same impression. I told my doctor I her nurse was nice but not at all reassuring or helpful. If I even had a clue who to write to about that and ask for some explanation I would do it.

"Hi Crosado
Thank you for your reply and reassurance. I can't remember whether I had ovulation discharge. I had all the symptoms of PMS I used to get: tender breasts, bloating, cramps, clumsiness then the bleed lasted 5 or 6 days in total, not particularly heavy. I haven't bled since. But the bleed started 2 weeks before the ultrasound and it was stil thick. Just worried because I've had very slight pelvic pain since. Only 1 out of 10 on the pain scale - not even that high really, just twinges. I need to stay busy and not think about it. And if it's bad news it's a straightforward op to remove all so not the end of the world. Thank you all for your support - you feel like my lifeline :o)

"Jane, you keep us posted on all results. But like you I never had the twinges pains and such until my period started after not having one for 19 months. I never had a repeated transvaginal ultra sound after my period stop so mine may still be the 9mm all I know is she said there wasn't a lot of tissue when she was performing the uterus biospy that was done on August 15, 2016. When is your biospy/test scheduled?

Will let you know how it is and the results, although I think it takes about 2 weeks for the results to come through.

"Yes I did have the bloated stomach (lower stomach) Now I'm concerned about the vagainal aches and pains sometimes burning. I never had this issue until this last unexpected period and all those bisopies and test. I get the achy on the side of vulva inside sometimes stingy pain and sometime a little sharper. I had all those test done internally from June 4 - August 18th 2016 I'm assuming that all is healed from all that, but still these pains off and on. I made appointment with my GYN for Oct 3 thats the sooniest I can get in. Sometimes the ach and pain is on the side other times straight through middle of vaginal and sometimes outside mound. This has my nerves and fear all kicked in again even though I have had two smears -transvaginal ultra sound - lower stomach ultra sound - 1 cervical bisopy - one attempted (failed) uterus biopsy and another uterus bisopy (successful one) and manual pelvic. Since I see no other women on here is getting these I'm in overdrive fear! I got the vaginal pains sometimes before and in past when a period was coming on. But since June 4th 2016 they have been closer together and lot more often. Now I have that C fear all over again!

"Oh you poor thing! Surely, after all those tests you can't have C. I would think that one of them would have shown it up. I wonder if we are more aware of every little ache and pain because of the fear and because of what we've already been through. Is it possible that you might have picked up a little infection because you've had so much poked into you and up you in the past 2 months? Or maybe it's your body's way of doing the menopause - we're all different and hormones are peculiar things. Oct 3 is only 3 weeks away so hang on till then and keep sharing your worries - it helps! xx

"It sounds almost exactly what I am going through. When I went to the doctor simply becasue of the bleeding alone, I was scheduled for an ultrasound and biopsy. The ultrasound was last week and I was told the lining was thin which was a good thing. Told it was probably a hormonal surge. Because the lining was thin, they did a blood test. I was under the assumption it was to test my hormonal levels to see if I was in menopause. I just got my results and it was the C125 test for cancer only. It is 14.2 which shows it falls in the normal range. Tomorrow is my biopsy. Still nervous until I get the results of that. One thing I learned is that this site is the ONLY place you should get information on this. The internet is all gloom and doom. Read the other stories on here and you will feel better. These ladies are wonderful. The rest of the internet will have you convinced that what you are going through is not common. Through this site and the technician who did my ultrasound I learned it is. I am not out of the woods yet as I still have to go for my biopsy, but I am feeling a lot better and you should too, especially since you are not that long after your 12 month mark. Probably a hormonal surge like me. Wow, I've come a long way in a week!

"You stop eating when you're worried and I eat more! So I had the biopsy. Like you said the biospsy itself was a little uncomfortable. However, there is a machine that they use to enter all of your information to make sure the biopsy and the patient getting it done are matched up. Well, the one they were using wasn't working. The doctor and the nurse are mumbling about the screen not working, they went and got someone else and now the 3 of them are mumbling...all while they are between my spread eagle legs.Really? So they decided after about 10 minutes of me laying like this to switch the machine because the connection wasn't working and the new one was o.k. All this was after the biopsy was done and she inserted the camera. I'm laying there with a camera hanging out of my privates that are no longer private! Anyway, my uterine lining is a 3.9 and I have a cyst on my ovary. They did another blood test after I requested one to find out my hormonal levels. I go back next Wednesday to find out the results. Right now the only problem is the cramping but getting better. Praying for all of us!

My first one after 3 visit with him and his attemped uterine biopsy (failed), pap smear and cervical bipsoy he did good and results was good BUT he kept scheduling surgery 3 times (which all got canceled due to insurance deductible not met and upper respirtory infection and then the chief of gyn canceled) He just wanted to take you in surgery and rip out anything there . The resonn he kept scheduling surgery was becuse he couldn't get the uterine biopsy said he didnt want to punch hole in uterus, that guy had me scared silly. I went in for a second opionion with the female chief of GYN she got the biospy done in office no problem she went in 3 times during that biospy she also did a manual pelvic (I hate them) . They called with results within 3 to 4 days thank God all was good and said I don't need to come back in until next year for regular check up. She did blood work to on hormones and thyroid. The shocking part is blood work showed me still peri-meno and NOT meno and I had went 19 months with no period and then had two! That transvaginal ultra sound with that mini killer looking ball bat I hated that test! She couldnt find my ovaries and had to run it on my stomach when she was done diging for lost treasure :-) I'm fat so when she was running it all over my lower stomach and pushing in so hard I thought I would be bruised and ruptured I took it as long as I could and then said ""well did you find them""?

I thought I felt myself ovulating like i use to before i was in menopause but put it out of my mind thinking it was not likely. Then a few weeks later I got a period just like I use to (3 days). it was a little unnerving though. My doctor had me get an pelvic utrasound which was simple, a pelvic MRI which was VERY loud, and an endometrial biopsy (take 600 mg of ibuprofen before to ease discomfort). All results came out fine, but it was nerve wracking waiting for results each time!

Before I had my hysteroscopy the consultant told me they would be specifically looking for cancer, my mind went straight into overdrive as you can imagine. I had an appointment already made for 2 weeks after the biopsy and on 1st September I had the results which were all clear, it was such a relief because after frantically googling I was in such a state until joing this forum where I realised how common it is to bleed after the menopause. The consultant said my ovaries were still active and if I continued to have periods for a while I could have the coil fitted. To be honest with you after he told me everything was okay I didn't listen much after that, I was just so happy to hear those words! As others have said, stay positive, I was told that it is very common for menopausal women to experience this and the possibility it is anything else is very low. Hope you hear soon and good luck xx

"Hi Kerry, I hope you get your results soon and that it's good news. I'm new to this site. Please can you tell me what to expect with the biopsy as I'm having one on Wednesday. Like others on this site, I've been bleeding after 14 months of no periods and my GP wants me to get everything checked out. I'm pretty scared because I haven't had children and the risks of cancer are higher. Also, I'm due to go to Brussels for work on Wednesday evening and I'm worried that I'll be feeling dreadful after the biopsy. Is it very painful? Did you have a lot of pain and bleeding afterwards? Anyone else that can tell me about the biopsy? I'm so relieved to find this site - it makes me feel less alone with it all. xx

"Hi Jane, just to reiterate what Kerry said about a biopsy. It is no more than an uncomfortable sensation and although you will experience cramping it is like a moderate period type cramp and will last for a few days. Take painkillers to help beforehand and afterwards. Good luck x

"Hi Angie and Kerry, thank you for replying. I'm 52 & have been having hot flushes etc for 2 years and no periods for 14 months. I feel ridiculous asking these things but they tell you so little. I'm having the ultrasound on Wednesday, I'm not sure if they're doing bloods or not. TBH, my GP said she'd send me for a scan, but the letter and leaflet I received for the Gyny and Oncology clinic talks about biopsies, so I'm not sure what they're going to do. I guess I'll find out on Wednesday - what fun! :o) Is it ok to take painkillers before the examination - or do they need to know if anything is painful? It's the waiting and not knowing that drives you mad, isn't it? Fingers crossed we both get the all clear as you did Angie. Have a good evening both of you. xx

"Hi Kerry, it's the waiting that makes your mind come up with the worst case scenario. Your doctor would have done the transvaginal if she could: it's easier and probably cheaper. With PM bleeding they HAVE to check it out so she had to do biopsy instead. How long ago was it? Try to keep busy so you don't think about it so much. I was working today and it really helped to keep me sane. In an earlier post you said that what she could see looked healthy which is a good sign. Treat yourself to something: a good glass (bottle!) of wine or a trip to the cinema or a facial - whatever floatsyour boat. Be kind to yourself! I'm thinking of you and sending an internet hug.

"Hi Hokuleilani
I've been through this myself the doctor sent me for an ultra sound and the person said you are fine they said we don't know why it happens but it does. Nothing to worry about just like a finishing off last show sort of thing.
I bled for one week like a light period then that was it nothing else since that was two years ago now.
The only time to worry is when you get chronic pain in that area but if there's no pain all should be okay..
All the best liz😀

"That is exactly how mine was. During the day as I was moving, the bleeding would get a litle heavier. By the time I went to bed at night it was almost non existent and then the next day I would start all over again. I went to bed feeling a little better and the next day would be filled with gloom all over again. After my tests I also started bleeding heavier. But you know worrying does not change anything. All it does is waste time that you can be enjoying with your family. I too am great at giving and not taking advice. It's just that when you are on the advice giving side, you can see and think more rationally. Said a prayer for you and everyone else at church today.

"Glynnie I know how you feel. In early July I had a strange pain in my very lower left abdomen, where the leg meets the body. I had the strangest tingling in my abdomen also low down but all over, really weird. Then I had blood from the rectum. I am a bit doctor phobic. All this while my husband was abroad on business and my nest just emptied completely. I went to my family doctor. My blood pressure was so high from nerves that hewanted to give me a pill! I told him I was just over anxious and it is not usually high. He sent me to a gynie, and a gastro. I also googled tons. I diagnosed myself with colon cancer, ovarian cancer, cancer all over that had spread everywhere, etc etc. The gynie did a Pap smear which I hadnt had in 8 years (really wrong of me, due to my stupid phobia), an internal ultrasound found a lump in my uterus which she thought was a fibroma but was not sure. She sent me to a clinic to do another internal ultrasound with a more detailed machine (never knew this difference in US devices even existed). The technician there does these all day everyday and assured me that the fibroma was just a fibroma. I then returned to my gynie with the results and she sent me to the clinic again to do an external US of the abdomen, to see all my organs. That one came out fine and all was okay. Of course going in created huge stress for me as did result waiting and follow ups with the drs. Then I went to the gastro dr and he ordered a colonoscopy because of the bleeding and my age- 55. Where I live people get colocoscopies from age 50, every 5 years. I, of course, didnt get one at age 50 (stupid me). The prep is not pleasant, but wasnt anywhere nearly as horrible as I had imagined. I had it done and it was also fine. So I had none of the diseases I thought I surely had. No ovarian cancer, no colon cancer, no cancer all over. I felt like I got a new lease on my life only to wake up at the end of Aug to bleeding like a period. I googled and was shocked. SO it began all over, back to the gynie, another internal US, a biopsy. I am now awaiting my results. This time, somehow, I put mind over matter and I am functioning much better than all of July. Keeping busy, reading books a lot helps really a lot, housework etc. I think I got a hormonal surge from all the stress I had. After all, all those tests in July found nothing. My endometrium layer was 3mm, thin and fine in July only to jump to 8mm at the end of Aug. I also had pre menstrual symptoms, like tender breasts etc, and a bit of a non bloody discharge before the period began. I spotted for two eeks nearly but now a few days ago it stopped. My breasts are back to normal as well- just like with a period. So I am trying hard to be optimistic, esp since odd are in my favor- and yours as well. And as I said, if Gd forbid it is cancer, it is most probably early stages. Lynda can maybe enlighten us more about that. I believe it is very treatable. I hope Lynda is okay health wise at least, and always will be. Lots of love to all the sisters out there in this thread.
Keep yourself busy and try hard to be calm, stress is so bad for us.

"You've really been through it lana - I think you're probably right about the stress. I've had similar symptoms to yours with pains where my legs meet my body and lower abdominal pain - very mild. My bleed happened after an unbelievable stressful month and I'm hoping that's all it was. One gyny (male) said it wasn't possible to have a bleed due to stress but the one I saw yesterday for my biopsy (female) said it was. So ???? Would like your opinions on this ladies: I'm 52 and my last smear or PAP test was 3 years ago. I asked the biopsy doc to do me a smear test whilst she was in there but she refused and said that because I am over 50, I only get one every 5 years. But surely after a post-meno bleed I should get the cervix checked out? I checked with her and the biopsy was only for the endometrium, not the cervix. Should I insist on getting one?

"Jane, I heard that stress can cause a surge in Estrogen. Seems logical to me. Here we are told to get a Pap once a year. I would insist. Especially with bleeding. It finds precancerous cells, so why wait till they become something else? Even doing privately if they refuse. I still have to have my yearly mammogram and breast US in Oct. And hope all is normal there and wait for results...last year they found a lump, which they were 95 percent sure was just a benign fatty lump, but took a biopsy to be safe. Needless to say that it was also very stressful, so now I am phobic with my boobs as well. Seems it never ends.

"Hi ladies, I'm in the same boat! 56 years old, no period for over 2 years. Two weeks ago I felt all the symptoms of getting my period. Sore breasts, break-outs, mod dines, discharge...then 2 days ago I began the bleeding with very tiny amount of blood. My Gyno ordered me immediate ultrasounds of pelvic and transvaginal. Waiting for the TV to come back. The pelvic showed some follicles still in one ovary. Also showed something with an A that I forgot how to spell, which ends up being similar to endometriosis, but inside the muscle. Recommended to have an MRI, but will wait for the more accurate test to determine what's really going on if anything. This all started after drinking a huge pot of homemade chicken soup broth while suffering a terrible cold. I'm convinced the hormones they shoot into livestock can alter our bodies hormones in negative ways. I have not had animal products in 4 decades. Stopped at age 17. Will report back my results, but just wanted to bring up the food, hormone, and chemicals in our every day food. Scary!

"Interesting you mention that because my specialist nurse said we are eating a lot of oestrogen in various ways - including livestock who have been treated with it eg chicken. Male fertility is declining because of it. I started having soya milk and yoghurts in the past few months because I read that it can help with hot flushes so I wonder if that's why I have thickened lining. I eat quite a bit of chicken too though I always buy free range - I guess you have to buy organic if you want to avoid horrible additives entirely but it's too expensive for my budget.

"O.k. so Im baaack! Just to recap....19 days after my 12 months of no period, I had a period. Over the next few weeks, had blood test, ultrasound, hysteroscopy, biopsy. All came back good. Doctor said I had a cyst on one of my ovaries that she wanted to do another ultrasound for on October 19. When I got my negative cancer results I asked what happens if I get my period again? She said we will cross that bridge if we get there. Well, 28 days later, I'm at that bridge again! I was told the blood tests show that I am borderline menopause ""but are considering you post menopausal"". Should I be worried about bleeding again? Everyone on here talks about getting their period after a long time but did anyone continue to get them. I'm 57 years old. ARen't I too old for this?

"This is just my opinion but I think you are not post menopause yet. Blood results were borderline and that's just one snapshot in time. Hormones fluctuate so much during this time. All your tests were fine, so this is hormonal. However, call and tell the doctor's office again. Let them decide what to do. My guess is they won't do anything.

"I think she's right that it isn't common. However, it does happen as we've seen on this forum. I think point is that you're not post menopause yet. Until you are, you can still have periods. 19 days past the one year mark is not necessarily post menopause. Our bodies don't follow calendars. So if I we're you, I'd see what the doctor says. Then decide if you need a second opinion.

The forum you joined may just be mostly comprised of women who were diagnosed with c, the symptoms are the same and that is why they do a biopsy, to be sure it is NOT c. Look how many have these symptoms and do NOT have c (90% of post meno bleeding). Let us know and I will keep checking in. We will be okay.

"I was at the gynie this afternoon. I will do a blood test for FSH, LH, TSH and Estradiol (e2) to check hormone levels, but she said to wait a b it on it, relax for a few weeks after so many tests this year and then do it and come to her. I also have to do another internal US to check on the fibroma just to track if it shrank or grew or whatever. Ugh. Next month I will do both. She said that my ovaries haven't shrunk enough to the menopause size so I am probably still peri menopausal. No need for birth control though as ovulation is extremely unlikely (hope so!!). She thinks that perhaps the Femarelle pill she gave me for hot flashes may have been enough to awaken things a bit, tip the scales and bring on a light period with all the bodily symptoms that accompany this, or that it perhaps it would have happened anyhow. Again, thanks all for the support and I hope all the explanations here - from all of us, will help other women going through all this. xxxx

While 12 months without a period is usually considered menopause, you're not really in menopause until your body says so. And you probably aren't quite there yet.

It is my firm belief that I am simply not finished yet, but I know the doctor will want to take other tests. What might I expect?
Another question:
I thought I read that if you had your first period late it it likely that menopause can be late. I am 54 and had my period at late 13-early 14. My mother had six healthy children, the last one at age 41. Is it possible that this is just late pre-menopause? How late is menopause known to start/finish?

I was doing just fine for several months on a low dose of Estradiol to eliminate my miserable hot flashes. Then I got my yearly exam and my doctor prescribed 2.5mg of generic Provera (I'm in the US) along with it, to decrease the chance of cancer or something. About ten days later, I forgot to take it for a couple of days and now I'm on day three of a total flood of a period after a year and a half without any (I'm almost 54). Come to find out, Provera is commonly prescribed to bring on periods- that's what it does. It now resides in the trash can. Also, if you can't tell, it makes me feel crazy hahaha.

I'm thinking it's really just not worth it and that I'll quit the HRT... And maybe that will stop this scary bleeding.

Over those 5 yrs I have had spotting, maybe a few days of normal periods but basically my periods had stopped. A few weeks ago I thought I had an urinary infection because I was frequently urinating and had some spotting, Dr sent me to get a urine test which came back that I did not have an infection but I did show that there was some blood, Dr did a quick exam and said that the blood was definately vaginal so she was concerned because she said I am in manopause and any abnormal bleeding is a sign of something wrong. I have an appt at my ob/gyn next week but of course I came online and searched my symptons and it all points to cancer. I am beyond stressed! I came here and read this thread and I feel a little better but my stress is just so high right now. Since seeing the Dr a week ago, I am now having what seems like a normal period, Normal period bleeding, with some clotting, cramps and headache, all exactly like a normal period for me. Could it be that I am not in manopause and that this is just a normal period? Are there any other signs I should be looking for? I am diabetic and I am over weight. Thanks

"June, hang in there! It is of course usually NOT cancer but as you know needs to be checked out just in case, and also because it could be something else that can be alleviated once it's diagnosed.
I think that while post-menopausal bleeding is considered ""abnormal,"" it really isn't that unusual (as seen by all the posts about it on here). Apparently, nobody informed our bodies about that ""one year"" rule!
I'm going through it now, too. Strangely, I'm not especially worried this time although I am quite annoyed and plan to demand a nice heavy sedative for the likely biopsy. I had a breast cancer scare a couple of years ago, had to get a biopsy, and was stressed and crazed until it was over (it was all okay). I wonder if scares get easier with practice or what the heck! Best wishes to you. I don't know about other signs but I would definitely say do NOT read anymore about cancer right now!

"Either you misunderstood or the doctor didn't quite state that right. It isn't a sign that something is wrong. It means something could be wrong. But as you can see here, a lot of us have had periods after menopause and nothing was wrong. Yes, it's possible you're not fully in menopause yet. It's also possible you had a surge of estrogen. I will say higher estrogen can happen when you're overweight. Working on that would be helpful.

"Hi June
Whino and Becky are right that cancer is only ONE possible explanation and usually it is NOT that. I really understand your worry and stress having just gone through the same experience myself. And the doctors tell us so little that it doesn't help. I was frequently urinating, had blood in urine but no infection found, had vaginal bleed after 14 months, had internal ultrasound which showed thickened womb lining. I was terrified! But mine turned out to be nothing - a hormonal surge as Becky suggested. Had antibiotics and the frequent urination went away but is back. Apparently, mild infections often don't show up in the urine tests. So please, please don't despair - it is highly likely that you had a period. And UTIs are extremely common in menopausal women.
Everything that is considered 'normal' is based on an average. So 'normal' menstruation is considered 28 days and we all know that's nonsense. Your doc would not be following guidelines if she didn't refer you for further tests but that does not mean that anything is necessarily wrong.
Stay calm, stay sane and keep sharing with us. J xx

"Hi Becky221,
I had the uterin biopsy and hysterscopy done this morning. I do have thickening of the uterus. It was a 15 in thickening. I misunderstood him. I thought he said thinning. The hysterscopy showed 2 large polyps, which have to be removed. It has to be done in a hospital setting under sedation. I should have results back from the biopsy on Thursday. Dr. said the bleeding is most probably coming from that. Now I'm worried about these Polyps. I think most polyps though are benign?? I hope to God so. I wont have this done until January.

"Hi Em
I was told by Dr that polyps are benign but need to be treated because they can cause greater problems if left. My lining was thickened too at 11 mm but I was fine, nothing found on biopsy so thickening alone does not mean anything bad. And remember: no news is good news so if you haven't heard by Thursday, that's a good thing! Polyps can cause bleeding and will show up as a thickened lining so it sounds quite likely that that's all it is. Do lots of other things until Thursday so you don't think about it too much and please let us all know when you get your results. xxx

"Oh OK... Polyps. Yes very common. I have a friend who has had several for many years. They cause heavy bleeding. They've been watching them to See if they will shrink but they haven't so far. One is very large. So she will probably have to have them removed. But they are benign. I think all or most polyps are.

"Hi Ladies,
I am back again. So it's 4 months after my D&C and removal of polyps and I'm bleeding AGAIN! Just had a vaginal ultra sound and my uterus is thick again. Dr. fixed that during the D&C 4 months ago. Anyway, they want to do another D&C and an MRI of the pelvic area. Possibly Hysterectomy if the recurring bleeding continues and the thickening continues. Appreciate your thoughts on your feelings of hysterecomy as a result of recurring bleeding. Has this happened to anyone in such a short amount of time?

Very distressed at this woman.I went home changed my diet. Lost 22 pounds. Started eating very well. Cut out salt sugar pop and caffeine. I had started taking a progstrone cream two months before the appt. Nurse told methat creamcouldn't do anything for me. I don't think it was thecream. I think it was thechanges I had made.

"I posted last week that I am 53 years old and that after being in menopause since July of this year that I started bleeding. I was terrified! I saw my Doctor and she ordered an ultrasound. She told me that if my endometrial lining was 4cm or more that I would need to have a biopsy. I had my ultrasound and my lining was measuring at 12cm. Now I was even more terrified. On Friday I had a biopsy. Yesterday my Doctor called me with the results and they were benign. She said that the bleeding and thickening of the lining was due to Estrogen Stimulation and that no follow up was needed. To anyone experiencing post menopausal bleeding, I know how scary it is. My advice is to just go to your doctor as soon as possible and get checked out. Hopefully you will receive good news just like I did.

"When it happened to me, my doctor said we continue to produce estrogen in other places than our ovaries. So a number of things, like stress, can cause us to produce enough estrogen to increase the uterine lining and cause what seems like a normal period. It's been almost 2 years since it happened to me and hasn't happened since. Very glad to hear that your biopsy was fine. But I really think you need a follow up since your lining was thick. It will probably go back down to normal, but what if it doesn't? How will you know? Sometimes you have to be your own advocate and when you talk to the doctor, maybe you should push for a follow up ultrasound to be safe.

"Exactly. I had the same experience. I also had a lot of stress this past year, health wise and issues with a brother. After so many tests, and biopsies I had to have my yearly mammogram and US breast tests. The Dr checked my left breast over and over again and eventually I began crying. At the end she said she didnt see anything but a team if drs review the results and I will get a formal answer by mail. I was a wreck and a few days later I started getting strong pain in my left breast. I read that stress can cause it, along with coffee and wine, especially if you have a benign lump, which I do. I took advil and a natural relaxant. And in two days it went away! I went to my dr but the pain was gone and he found nothing and the results were negative! Stress is so bad for us.

"Hi ladies,
Bit of background, I'm nearly 43, no children, I have been post menopause for 20 months (early menopause runs in the family, my mum, her twin sister and grandmother were all post menopause by 41.
So it was no surprise when started getting peri symptoms at 38 hot flushes and later on also night sweats and lighter and erratic periods) Last period 1st April 2015, before that had 4 month gap.
On Friday evening (2nd) out of the blue started bleeding. No warning signs that I'd used to have, bloating, mild cramps shortly before etc, only thing I've noticed recently is that haven't had any hot flashes or night sweats for about 3 months)
Bleeding lasted 2 days, flow similar to normal period for those 2 days but no cramps with some spotting following 2 days.
I went to doctor Tuesday and he's requested a transvaginal ultrasound scan appointment, awaiting to hear from hospital (not looking forward to that, and how much do you want to bet it will be on my Birthday in just over a weeks time. 😯 )
Reading the posts on here has been really helpful and I wanted to tell my story for others, I know we are all different but I found it helpful to be able to relate to others on here, even if only in part. I'm fairly confident it's just my bodys hormones playing games but I equally understand it is is better to be safe and get checked out.
I had an abdominal ultrasound at start of year, biopsy for changes in bladder lining and CT scan for urology issues which found nothing untoward, just a very small cyst on my right ovary, slightly swollen right kidney possibility due to mild urine retention which the ultrasound picked up which I didn't even know I had ( changes in my bladder were benign). Didn't answer why I have daily mild pain / discomfort in my right side for nearly a year now, must tackle doctors again on finding some answers but that's for another day!
I'll report back after my scan and let you know how I got on.

"Sounds familiar! Transvaginal ultrasound is nicer than getting a smear test - the person who did mine let me insert it myself which made it very easy and I had no discomfort. I notice you haven't had children - neither have I and from my experience, if you need to go on to have a hysterectomy or uterine biopsy, ask your GP for a strong painkiller and a muscle relaxant eg Diazepam beforehand. Your cervix won't ever have stretched so it's difficult to get through. Just a tip! Good luck and please let us know how you get on with your scan. xx

Hopefully will have appointment date soon for scan and will report back afterwards.

"I once got a pap report tht was nomal but was written that the procedure done was not optimal- as a rating- due to blood in the sample, so I guess that is why she waited. I would, however get a second opinion, as while I had my ""period"" after a year of none, my gynie did a Pipelle biopsy right then and there. It was a bit uncomfortable but really not terrible. She also first did an internal vaginal ultrasound. My breasts were also tender and I felt PMS symptoms , just like you did. My results were negative and life went on, until I had a second bleed 4 months later, again some slight PMS, especially moody. I ran, literally, back to my gynie, totally traumatized. She again did an internal US. She didnt really see anythingnew at all but said that at this point I need to do a hysteroscopy (like a colonoscopy but in the cervix and uterus) at the hospital. It was a week ago, under general anaesthesia, like an operation, dont know why, I guess, they thought they may need to remove a polyp or something and do another biopsy of the uterus lining. Anyhow, the gynie surgeon said everything looked fine and he is quite certain that the biopsy results will be negative as they were last time. I am now awaiting results but feel okayish. I believe all that I described is the globally accepted way of dealing with post menopausal bleeding, for the first and if there is a second time. Mostly, the overwhelming majority are negative results. And even if not, then usually the uterus is just removed and mostly, that is the end of that. So calm down, I am quite certain you are okay, but it does need to be properly checked to make sure. hugs!!

She also did a pelvic examination and diagnosed vaginal atrophy due to low estrogen, which might not have caused the amount of bleeding I had, but it would answer a few other issues I've had.

"Hi ej, last year I had blood in urine for the first time in my life (I'm 52). Tests didn't show up an infection & I had no burning or pain. Sent off for test for bladder + kidney cancer. A week later I had a vaginal bleed after no period for 14 months so was sent off for vaginal US & then biopsy as my lining was 10mm. All tests results were clear - thank goodness. I still have no medical explanation as to why it all happened but I was extremely stressed at the time. As our bodies change, I think a lot of these things happen & docs in NHS don't have time or money to investigate further if it's not life threatening.
You said you were taking cider vinegar - a lot of acid in the diet (citrus fruits, tomatoes, vinegar) can irritate the bladder and make you wee a lot. If the bladder gets too empty it's more prone to infections. Other irritants include caffeine & alcohol.
So... drink pure water, have a balanced diet and do stuff you enjoy to take your mind off your health until you get tests done. As Lana said, anxiety can really exacerbate a sensitive bladder. Good luck and keep us posted. J xx

"As we get older our ovaries start to shrink away and it can be hard for the technicians to locate them. I'm not sure how old you are and whether you're still menstruating(?) but it could just be that one of your ovaries was hiding away. I've never seen an ovary 🐣 but I think they're pretty small to start with.
My top tips for surviving the hideous waiting for results: 1) stay as busy as possible; 2) spend time with other people as much as possible; 3) stay away from Google; 4) when it all gets too much - ask for support from this forum. And a CBT technique that works for some people: think the worst and make a rational, practical plan for how you would deal with that. Write it down and then leave it. Every time your mind strays to ""what if?"" remember that you've dealt with that and have a plan so you can move your mind on to other things.

"Hi,
I'm aware this is an old thread but after 13 months no period I've had very light spotting and bad stomach cramps as well as tender breasts before the spotting. I'm 48 and have been referred for an ultrasound and whatever else the gynaecological department at the hospital deem fit. Not looking forward to it as I have LS in my vaginal area so I'm going to be pretty sore. However, being healthy is my main concern. Trying to keep calm and not panic but it's not easy 😢

"Hi ej21467
Well I was supposed to have had my ultrasound and hysteroscopy today but yesterday after reading horrendous stories online from women who had tremendous pain getting the procedure done with no anaesthetic or pain meds I was in a right state crying hysterically to my husband on the phone 😢
I suffer from lichen sclerosis and I'm sore every day and never had children which apparently makes it more difficult, so after terrorising myself I made a doctor's appointment for tomorrow and I'll ask to be referred for a general anaesthetic.
My doctor A MAN 🤔 said to me if I expected it to be sore it will be.
Hmmmmm, might just turn up with knitting needle in hand and tell him it won't hurt where I'm about to shove it 😲
I've never had a GA either and I hate needles so that'll be something else for me to worry about 😆
So glad you've had good news.
Just to have peace of mind is bliss! xxx

"I am not sure how much discomfort lichen sclerosis would cause for the tests but I would definitely ask for GA if you are worried. Personally I had zero discomfort or pain from either procedure, but I am not in your situation. I wonder if the women you read about had other things going on that caused the discomfort. Will be watching for good news from you so please post. Praying for you, ((((-;

"I'll be right behind you in the queue with the knitting needle. I haven't had children and my hysteroscopy and biopsy was absolutely excruciating - which I wasn't expecting. I was sick after and couldn't move for 45 minutes so anyone who says it's all in the mind is talking nonsense. However, I was ok after an hour and a strong painkiller so don't let it put you off. If I had to have it again I would either go for a GA or a sedative and strong painkiller before the procedure. Good luck and let us know how you get on. xxxx

"I agree with what everyone is saying on these blogs! If you have vaginal bleeding two years after menopause go see your doctor. My doctor performed a vaginal ultrasound and found thickening of my uterine lining as well as a cyst on my ovary. My doctor was not overly concerned and said to repeat the ultrasound in two months and added that the cyst may go away on its own. Two months later the cyst was still there and my uterine lining had gotten thicker. She did a biopsy on the uterine lining tissue which was negative. My blood was also tested which also was negative for cancer. Both very good signs. However since the uterine lining continued to thicken and cyst had not go away, my doctor recommended a D&C and had me meet with a gynecologist. The gynecologist decided to not only do a DNC but to remove my ovaries as well. I had the procedures done three weeks ago and am recovering well. My pathology report came back negative and I am so relieved. I was told that the cyst was a type that contained estrogen and this estrogen was being released into my uterus causing the thickening of the lining. So thank you to everyone who has submitted entries to this blog. All very helpful. And I agree with what I read on these blogs. Definitely talk to your doctor if you experience bleeding after menopause.

The blood tests came back saying that I wasn't menopausal and gyni did all scans etc and signed me off. Periods went to about every 3 months then 6 months then eventually stopped in sept 2015! Had regular smears and had one in November which is when spoke to the nurse and she told me that if I had a bleed go to Drs. So last week when I started bleeding didn't hesitate. Xx

"Hello ladies!
First I want to thank you tracie for starting this thread. I would have had a hard time getting through the last few days if not for reading all of the posts on here.
I am in the US, 53 years old and have not had a period in at least 12 months and probably longer. I woke up Saturday and realized I was spotting (now turned into a regular period). I called my obgyn on Monday morning and she told me to come in. She did an exam and confirmed bleeding from the uterus. She did a biopsy and sent me for an TVUS. She said she wasn't going to to a PAP since I was bleeding and it could give false results (so I'm scheduled for that later). As soon as the ultra sound was over she went over the results. 2 small fibroid tumors and the lining of my uterus thickened 15mm. Knowing I was nervous, she promised to call as soon as she received the results of the biopsy saying it could take up to 5 days. To my surprise, she called me the next morning telling me there was no cancer! PRAISE THE LORD! She also told me that she had had patients in their 60's and 70's that came in with bleeds, thicker uterus than mine and all was ok with them too.
So, my reason for posting this is to let anyone reading it know that if you have a bleed after 12 months...go have it checked, but try not to worry too much.

I just went through a biopsy and then a few onths later, I had a second bleed. I was sent to do a hysteroscopy under General Anaesthesia and was told that results would be in a month. I was luck for getting results within two weeks, and esp as they were negative. Thanks so much for sharing- it is uplifting.

"I will be back after my appointment in April to share what he said. At this time, from what my husband learned, it seems that when we are in Post-meno, the endometrial lining continues to break down until there is none. As it thins, there can be disruption of the blood vessels underneath which can cause bleeding. It is common and apparently one of the [u]first[/u] things suspected, although they want to immediately rule out anything else and therefore the need to check for begnin polyps, etc. and endometrial thickening, which isn't necessarily a problem either if there has been a recent hormone surge. (Found it interesting that thyroid fluctuations are common in Post-meno and can affect estrogen which can in turn cause surges and incidents that lead to thickening and shedding of endometrium. Ovulation doesn't need to occur at all for this to happen.) The u/s showed my lining at 3.5mm I think he said, which is normal. So I am expecting he will tell me I am in the 'thinning' category. I gather there are ways to deal with it if the bleeding or discomfort is a problem. But basically it isn't a big deal and may never happen again. My question for him will be why it went 5 days and followed the pattern of a regular period, ie., breast tenderness, cm a week prior. However, if it is normal for the lining to break down Post meno, then perhaps we go through cycles and just aren't aware of it until something 'shows'. Wouldn't that be interesting. If true, then women are going through something normal that just needs a routine check, in case...and not the panic it is causing.
Wish the medical community online, the top ranking sites, would change the way their information is presented, to let women know ALL the things it probably is, including thyroid (which I never saw anywhere), before stating the most scarey possibility. Surely they can say it is necessary to go to the Dr. and a) rule it out for peace of mind, or b) catch it in time in the low percentage case, that it is life-threatening, without all the drama.
Then women would still be wanting to be safe rather than sorry without going through needless anxiety and fear for weeks and months. And some may never go at all out of dread and miss something important or live in terror for nothing.
I believe God had a reason for me to go through all this and I learned a lot. Including to trust him more than Google.....(shame on me). Thanks to everyone who kept telling me to stop reading the negative. God bless all of you on here with peace and calm. Will repost in a couple months. Take care.

"So this latest is already over. Nothing more after a bit yesterday. Dr said thinning of the lining due to low estrogen a leading cause with women post meno and not to worry if it shows up again. The only time it could become a 'problem' is if it happens a lot or lasts a long time, then I could consider estrogen therapy. He wants me to keep him posted but says it's nothing serious. He said I may see it again a time or two, I may not. Again all tests negative, nothing irregular and my lining was very thin.

I asked what he wanted to see my about in April and he said it was just to have a face to face and make sure I wasn't worried or stressing when I didn't need to be. He said if I didn't want to come in, it was up to me. But he said he'd like to discuss anything else related to my health that I may have questions about. He is just a little older than my husband and I and says all kinds of little things occur as we get older that usually end up being no big deal. He said if we know what some of the common things are, we will panic less....and Google less.

"Hi ladies. Forgive me if this is duplicative, but my original post vanished. I began menopause about 5 years ago. My periods stopped about 2.5 - 3 years ago. I was on a very mild synthetic hormone to help with hot flashes. About 8 months ago, I began spotting. I went to my doctor who ordered an ultrasound and found the lining of my uterus to be too thick. She gave me something to MAKE me have a period, but it really didn't do much. When I went back for a follow up ultrasound, the lining was a little thinner but still thicker than she wanted. She told me I could watch it for a few months and if things didn't change, she wanted to do exploratory surgery. Well, at this point, I have been having a non-stop period for about 2 - 3 months accompanied by occasional, light cramps; I have had to resort to tampons because it's more than spotting. I also have a clear, foul-smelling vaginal discharge. I tried to get in to see my doctor, but she's out on maternity leave. Now I have started a new job and do not have health insurance yet. I researched the clear discharge and read that can sometimes be due to an imbalance in estrogen. So I'm looking into supplements for that. Has anyone else encountered a perpetual period during menopause? I am not a worrier, but it is just really annoying, especially the nasty discharge! I always feel like a need a bath.

Well this forum has put my mind at rest (a bit)
My last period was Christmas 2014, nearly three years ago!
At the beginning of last month my breast suddenly felt tender, swollen and my nipples hurt too.
l had white clear discharge, so l think l was ovulating too.
l thought l was pregnant though at 56!!!!
Then we went camping 🙄😱
I woke up early in the morning absolutely soaked, with blood everywhere...l was having a very heavy period, with the classic period pains to go with it!
Totally cheesed off l took some paracetamol and had to make my excuses to go home early.
l just thought it was one of those things, as a nurse friend of mine told me a few years ago that this happened to her!
But today l thought l would go on the internet, just to check if l should just leave it. ??
My period lasted one week, and the weakness in my bladder has now ceased! (this was quite normal for me in the past)
l have had no more discharge, or any blood spotting, and my breasts have now returned to normal.
Anyway after reading this thread, l panicked and phoned my doctor.
So l am now having a blood test tomorrow and seeing a gynaecologist next week.
l'm now a tad worried as the period was on the 25th August, nearly three weeks ago!
Not good with tests, as l had a colposcopy a few years ago!

"Hello. I have read every one of the posts on this thread in the past few days and have definitely received some comfort. Like so many of you, I started bleeding after 2 1/2 years of no period. I'm 47. A week or so ago, I had nipple sensitivity and I was rather emotional, but I didn't think much of it. Plus, I broke out with some acne. (I have often felt some sort of hormonal goings on in the past couple of years even though they say, when you are done you are done!) But, then I was crampy all day the other day, like my period was coming. That evening, I had a bit of spotting, but not a full on period. I scanned the internet and feared the worst. Two days later, I was at the dr. He did a biopsy (for which I am awaiting results), blood tests for FSH, LH and TSH and today I had US. FSH and LH show I am definitely in menopause, though FSH is lower than when he tested me a year ago. US showed some blood in my uterus and 5mm wall thickness. But, the thing that has me really freaked now is two small ovarian cysts, on on each ovary. The dr had the nurse call with a quick report and said they appear to be benign, but the report I see online only talks about their size. I called back asking for more info from the doctor and am awaiting a call. She said he was out and I may have to wait a few days, by which time the biopsy should be back.
I'm just posting to share my story and seek a little bit of comfort. I'm a single mom, so it's kind of scary being alone in all of this. Thanks.

"Hi Bettie
Look firstly try not to worry - I know it's hard though xx my results came back fine. The walls are an indicator - thin is good sign of menapause. Mine were thin but as they thought there was some blood during my exam and I had had 3 of these scans previously (like I say I appear to have a light spotting day once a year or so) so they said I needed the camera. On the day it was fine and the lady said because my walls are so thin the blood they had seen during my exam could have been from the walls and the spitting that t get once a year or so although no medical to back this up could have been through stress. I have found that this is very common problem to have a period out of the blue and the staff told me of all they see every month they only have approx 2 people every month in that hospital diagnosed with the dreaded C word. I found that greatly comforting as they see a lot of patients - I hope this helps ease your mind a little xxx

"HI, I think I've read all the posts, but haven't found anyone my age. I'm 63 and haven't had a period for 12 years. A month ago, during a very stressful time, I got a period. It came with all the extras-cramps, mood, even my usual zit. The bleeding was very light-only on the toilet paper. First red then brown. After 5 days it stopped but I was still crampy. I had already scheduled my appt. with GYN. His first words were that it is very unusual for a woman my age to have a hormone surge after 12 years no matter how stressed I was. I had the ultra sound inside vagina and a uterine biopsy. The scan was perfect. Not too thick or thin. Showed no lumps or bumps and although he could only get 2 tiny pieces for the biopsy, he said that was a good sign. The biopsy was negative. Great news. Except we are both puzzled because of the rarity of hormonal surge at my age and is leaving it up to me if I want further tests that require hospitalization or a hysterectomy. Right now I'm saying, let me see if it comes again in 28-30 days like a regular cycle. What would you do? It's in the back of my mind that it happened. Everything so far looked great. But there has to be a reason or does there???????

I do think if he thought I should go for further tests, he would outright tell me. I guess he can't guarantee anything. Thanks for your response

"Wow, I had no idea foods had estrogen. I haven't had anything you mentioned, but besides being stressed out I started doing some real physical yard work a couple hours each day after I hadn't been physical for over 3 years due to back surgery. This year I said this is enough I need to get out and move. I was digging and pulling and bending and wow everything in my body hurt. But it felt good to be working on my flower beds. I was wondering if a change from basically laying around for 3 years and suddenly go crazy working hard in the yard might play a factor. I got the same answer-not having a period for 12 years and age 63, it's hard to imagine a hormone surge. I am going to research various foods and estrogen and see if I'm consuming anything. Thanks so much. I need to find an answer to relieve my worries !!

"Hi Bettie. I'm sorry for the slow response. My notifications went into spam so I wasn't aware that there was any activitiy on this thread. I hope you are doing ok. Did you get your results back yet?
My biopsy was benign, thankfully. And the doctor told me to call him if I had any more bleeding. I haven't, but two weeks after that spotting, I had ovulation type cramping for a few days. I will not be surprised if I bleed again in a week or so. I know my estrogen is low and my fsh is high, but I swear, my body is trying to have a cycle.
My doctor didn't want me to worry about the ovarian cysts but because I am, he ordered an ultrasound in three months to check on them.
I hope you are doing well. Please post back to let me know!

"Hi. My story is similar to many here. I am 48. I am 15 months since my last period. Had blood work done in march and fsh was high so my doctor said I was in menopause. Two weeks ago I had the breast tenderness, nausea, cramping I used to get prior to my period. Then last week I went to the bathroom and wiped and there it was. It was red not brown and not heavy. Basically only when I wiped or just a little on a pad over a whole morning. I already had a checkup scheduled for that day so I immediately told my doctor. He sent me to have a tvu the next day. It wasn't that bad of a process except I was sore after. I saw mentioned in earlier posts, but she couldn't locate my ovaries either which she said was actually a good sign. Doctor called Thursday and my uterine lining is showing ""overgrowth"". They didn't tell me the thickness and I didn't want to know because in this forum I have learned that is not an indicator of anything much. My daughter graduated from hs and we are leaving to go on a trip Monday through Friday, so I had to put off my ends biopsies until I get back. I go June 19 and I am nervous. I have gained weight since Christmas, and I have had some crampy nonspecific pain in my upper abdomen radiating to under my right shoulder blade. Had ultrasound back in February to check for gallbladder issues and they couldn't find anything and the pain went away. So now here I am waiting to have biopsies and I am scared. I am a single mom and I take care of my elderly mom. This forum has been a lifesaver because I mistakenly googled when it first happened and I had almost planned my funeral. Thank you ladies for sharing your experiences and for any words of wisdom you may have for me

"Hi
So I along with a lot of ladies here am in the same boat. Nothing for 14 months then some breast tenderness, zits, slight emotional swing and couple of weeks later some spotting. If my periods had not stopped I would have sworn I was due.
Off to the docs smear test (was due one anyway) scheduled Monday and waiting on the date for the TVU .
Worried well of course the what might it be possibilities are bound to go through your mind, but the accounts here have me reassured. The doc said it is standard procedure to check it out and that the majority of the time it is nothing nasty.
Best of luck with your tests hopefully we will both get a your fine verdict.

I googled this because after 9 years of being post menopausal this is happening to me.
This first happened about July 16 - i reported to to my GP, had a smear test (which came back fine) and the referred me to my local hospital for further investigations.
Just after Christmas i had an inter vaginal ultrasound and everything was found to be fine, now both last month (July 17) and now August, i am having light bleeding lasting 3-5 days.
Is this normal for anyone else here? Please, any advice would be welcomed.

"Hi Jane
I know it is a scary feeling but read the posts here and be reassured. Just back from my tvu and was told that they see a lot of us ladies in the pmb clinic and that only rarely is it anything serious. My results my lining is thin 3mm which is good but a couple of small cysts on one ovary. Again was told this is fairly common and in the vast majority of cases nothing to worry about. Still because post menopausal and because it is best practice blood test and follow up tvu in 4 months. Still not free of worry but still rare for the expert to call anyone back before the scheduled follow up she said. Best of luck to you.

"Appreciate this discussion. I'm almost 52, over 2 years no period then started bleeding 2 days ago. Got into the doctor that day and she was primarily concerned about ruling out cancer first so I got scheduled for a transvaginal ultrasound this coming week. Will keep this thread informed of the outcome. But to me, this seems like a normal somewhat heavy period. Moderate cramps.
Aprox 10 days prior, I had abdominal tenderness, breast tenderness, and what was normal discharge during my reproductive years so I think it was what they call a ""rogue ovulation"" and I am experiencing the subsequent menstrual period.

A few weeks ago when this started up again I was just spotting and went for the ultrasound. Lining was 4.2mm and am scheduled for biopsy on the 27th. In the meantime, I just knew I was going to get my period because I had all the signs...cramping, feeling of ovulation etc. Well here it is...I think I just got my period! Does this make thing better or worse for the outcome of the biospsy?
Past history for those that don't know....Sept 2016 had period after 13 months with none...ultrasound and biospy came back fine...determined to be a hormonal surge. Now 15 months after last spotting....spotting 2 weeks ago...ultrasound came back with endometrial thickness 4.2mm....scheduled for biopsy on the 27th.

"Please try not to worry. I know it's hard to do. Since I went and had my ultrasound two years ago, I've been having sporadic periods that no longer follow the regular pattern I had been used to for decades. Now when I get one, it can be the regular 28 days apart for a few months, then I don't have one for a few months. Whereas they used to start one day, and then go for 5-6 days total, now I'll start spotting for a day, then nothing for a week, and then it starts going for a few days. I don't know if it's just the plumbing slowing down, or perhaps the effects of coming off hormonal birth control after so many years. I think it's likely this way for a whole lot of women, and doctors either don't understand it or don't want to admit it. Here in the US, I do think they like to do a whole lot of procedures that aren't medically necessary, under the guise of better safe than sorry.

"I cannot tell you not to worry because you will anyhow. I can tell you that bright it other spotting or fuller period is not what concerns the gynie, any or either warrants the same standard procedure. It makes sense it is spotting as your lining was not very thick so there is not much to shed. Since last time was negative chances are very very low, like 2-3% of it being anything serious according to scholarly articles I read when I had spotting for a second time. Also, being in a closed and contained organ, GD forbid it is something, luckily it it is almost always highly treatable and removing the organ is almost always all that is required. I would push for an earlier biopsy if possible.

"Hi there
Don’t panic!!
It’s happened to me. I went for an ultra sound, and they found nothing wrong. It’s just called the last laugh . Or last show. For pre menopause.. I’ve had nothing since.
If you experience more after that, go and get it checked again.
But menopause it’s a right pain when you first get it. You’re body is on the change, so we have to adjust and accept it unfortunately.
Just eat lots of fruit and veg, and exercise as much as you can.
Stop the podgy area of your abdomen, from protruding exercise stretch exercises too. Don’t sit around slouched on chairs and sofas for a long time either. Stand up right and sit upright too. Anything to help your posture.. 😊👍🏻

I saw him and my mind and apparently my body betrayed me. I started experiencing another familiar feeling bloating and cramps, but I said it was lust my back acting weird from doing more physical activities, but low and behold tonight about 20 minutes ago my cycle stared out of the blue. I am totally bombed. I am going to sleep now and see what the morrow brings. Stunned.

"I will be 55 years old in July of this year which is 2018. When I was 47 years old my gynecologist since I was age of 16 and I trust dearly told me I had the Big M . Prior to this when I was 37 he tied my tubes after my fourth child. My period's became extremely hard and knocked me down for 2 days to 3 days at a time each month regularly to the day. As I got older at 47 he told me I'd hit the Big M at the age of 48 he gave me for the heavy bleeding and clotting an Ablation. The periods became very much lighter I then began to have fun menopausal hot flashes never night sweats my libido was never affected irritability of course yes periods were starting to become closer together further apart so I always kept track of them on a calendar. Have always been faithful with Pap smears and mammograms he always told me also I was always so very normal. As soon as I turned 51, I stopped having my periods all together. I will be 55 July 2018 so it has been 3 years 8 months with no. No cramping until February of 2018 I started experiencing cramping as back pain severe. I also had fresh blood just once and it was gone so I contacted my personal care physician she sent me to my OBGYN where and a three-week course I had three vaginal ultrasounds and on my stomach, three pap smears, 1 cervical check, CAT scan with contrast and bent over in pain so bad I could not stand nor set..... GYN she put me on progesterone and an antibiotic of Doxycycline in pill form and told me to come see her in one month. It is now at the point where all the pills are gone taken as prescribed and sure enough I started my period and have been bleeding for 3 days very light heavy cramping and severe back pain. What is going on?

"Also she stated she wanted to put me or bring on a period because back in February I only spotted once and she did find a cyst on my uterus the size of the end of her finger tip which she was not concerned about. After I go out the medication she gives me now I'm bleeding this is day number 3 and I'm about ready to bite someone's head off my poor husband

"Hi I'm 51, and 5 weeks ago had some brown spotting , after 2 years of no period, when I went to the toilet. It only happened the once but I saw my doctor, who referred me to a gynaecologist. I've since had TVU and was told by the scanner that the only thing she could see was either a very small cyst or a collapsing folicle ? and a little fluid in my womb . I've since goggled fluid in the womb and it's come back with the big C so am now terrified .
This is the second time I have been through this, the last time was 2 years ago when there was small thickening of the womb (4.2) I had a biopsy but everything was fine. But because it's the second time I'm booked in for a hysteroscopy tomorrow afternoon . Not looking forward to it, have heard it can be painful.

"Hi,
i had same, no period for 18 months, then spotting. ,then full bleed like a period .I’m .51 , started peri around 7 yrs ago.
Went to doc, sent me to hospital , had transvaginal ultrasound and exam of cervix. ,using camera. Both were healthy and normal . They saw nothing to concern them, and said doing anything more invasive wld do more harm than good. Obviously they cldnt explain bleeding, so put it down to hormone surge, a period. Told me to keep a record over next 5 months ,if I get any bleeds that is, then go to doc after that, and they will investigate further next time .
Its very common , so don’t be overly concerned , just get it checked out with doc.

"I just logged in, seaching the internet because i am having the same problem. At least now I see it appears to be a fairly common issue. I experienced menopause prematurely due to immunodeficiency caused by not having a thyroid gland! So nothing has been normal with my body for the last 20 years, since I had it removed. But this scared me at first. I thought something was seriously wrong. Thank you everyone for your comments, they were helpful in realizing their was no need to panic.

Not a lot, but it was there and seems to have stopped now, but I was worried sick and could not sleep. I looked it up online and this was the first place I found. I’m 52 and my last period was 2 years ago. The past few days though oddly enough, I’d noticed my breasts have been really sore and quite painful, but today they’ve been ok. I’ve had no pain, or no cramps at all, which I used to suffer badly from during a period. ......I feel a bit better now I know it’s common, but I will be phoning the doctor today to make an appointment to checked out. I did have a biopsy done at the age of 26, after a cervical smear, but it came back ok.

"Hi there, Same here. Mine has totally stopped now, I didn’t need pads and there was hardly anything there, but it was still there and noticeable. It’s strange, but in the past few days I’d also noticed more of a clear discharge, which I’d also get prior a period and I remember thinking that I was getting symptoms similar to when I used to have a period, like more of a discharge and painful boobs. Then this happens. So I don’t know what to think. I’m also the same as you, in that I’ve never had a check up in years. Longer than 10 years. My last smear, was probably about 1996, give or take a couple of years, so about 24 years ago, which is an awfully long time. I hate the thought of them too. But I guess I will need to go. .....So did you get checked out, after you first noticed it?

I am so glad to hear something common and similar coming from all you ladies my period totally stopped in 2014 in December 2016 I actually had a 14-day. I went to the doctor to get to ultrasounds the regular one and the vaginal one ... The vaginal one's are pretty expensive. I didn't need to see my uterus 3D but it was :-) The results were fine; however last year December 2017 it happened again December around Christmas time I had a 14-day period. So I don't know what's going on my doctor never heard of that before but she says I'm healthy and nothing is wrong... so I look at it as, at the end of the year I need 14 days to cleanse before the New year! I'm 48 yrs old... so maybe these are my symptoms of premenopause Everyone's body is different and this may be how my body prepares for Menopause ~

"Hi Eileen, I am same age as you and yes, book an appointment soon as you can. As you can see, it’s very, very common and it is a bit of a relief to see how common it is. Since I posted and over past 3 days, mine became a lot heavier, I had to buy sanitary products, but it is subsiding and becoming lighter now. It’s been exactly like a period, only I’m getting no pain, just a heavy feeling. I phoned the doctors day after bank holiday, Tuesday and have an appointment tomorrow. I think they are going to check to see if I’m actually in menopause, because despite not having a period for over 2 years, I’ve never actually been verified as in menopause. I just assumed I was with my last being over 2 years ago. Truth is I probably am, but they just want to rule it out I guess. If you need to talk, there’ll always be someone here for you. Good luck.

"Hi Ladyspice and thanks. Its what I am now dreading actually, being in full menopause and because of stories like yours. And because I’m ‘borderline’, I am not far off.
For the past 2 years and 5 months, I thought I was already in menopause at aged 52 and given I’d had no period for all that time. So I’d just assumed I was having an easy menopause, as I wasn’t getting the hot and cold sweats as other women describe. .......Sometimes I feel quite hot and my face is flushed, but I’m not breaking out in sweats or other menopause symptoms. So I’m dreading all that.
But it just goes to prove how wrong the medical textbooks can be. In that if we’ve not had a period in 12 months and we are in our fifties, we can assume we’ve hit or are in the menopause.........Well I’m proof of how wrong the textbooks can be. You can still not be in the menopause, even if you’ve missed a period, for 2 and a half years and you are in your fifties.
Another blood test is scheduled for me in November, to check if I’m in menopause then. Meanwhile, I’ve been told to expect further periods and told I still could get pregnant. Just as well I was divorced a few years ago and not in a relationship since. 😳

This had been going on for months and was getting worse.. I'm finely seeing a difference.. She told me on this medication the most I can take is 0.6 Mg I take it nightly before bed because it can cause stomach upset you can't take it on an empty stomach..so far so good none of those issues. I just hope it gets better I am still experiencing the hotflashes during the day but they are small and don't last very long and not as often. I'm keeping my fingers crossed because there is not a lot of options for medications for me because I still have my uterus and lady parts..Good Luck to everyone that's going on this roller coaster called menopause.

"Hi Debra
How did you get on? Have you heard any thing yet? I would have been two years without periods in June. In April started getting very painful boobs a bit like I had with pms. Then May Day bank holiday Monday had very pale pink bleeding. Thought it may be just a spot but it carried on, I went to doc she did an exam said my cervix look inflamed (?!) sent me to gynaecologist dpt had vus which showed a small cyst on an ovary and a small fibroid as well as thickened womb lining. Then I had a hysteroscopy. The consultant said everything looked ok but took a biopsy. I was too shocked after exams to ask questions and just wanted to get out of there. Not heard back since but a month later I’m having another period, this one is more like the ones i used to have. I have been back to my gp about my 2nd bleed but she did nothing and I have tried to call the hospital but they won’t say anything except they have a backlog. I mean reading all these posts has massively put me as ease but the big C thing is always at the back of your mind. I have been married 25 year mid June and was supposed to be going on a second honeymoon but I haven’t even booked thing because I am so worried that i won’t want to go.

"Glad I found this website!
I'm 52 years old and have not had a period for 2 full years. Recently I was on the airplane back from Europe and found a show! It was very light and lasted 2-3 days. I also had the usual symptom of cramp. In any case, it felt like a period, not a full one, but very much like the kind I was having before it completely stopped 2 years ago.
I googled and was sooo scared. Went to my primary physician right away. She sent me to have a TVU. The results came back normal. Nothing out of ordinary was found. My doctor said nothing more needs to be done. If I have more bleeding, I should visit her again.
I'm just trying to make sense of this. PMB must be caused by something, right? TVU did not reveal anything. What is that something then? Unless I'm not postmenopausal? I have no typical menopausal symptoms described by my friends. I mean no hot flash, no temper flare etc. I thought I was having an easy menopause.
Does anybody have similar experience? Any extra steps I should be taking now?

"Hiya. You are the same age as me. Like you I’d not had a period in 2 years, 5 months, then suddenly I had one. I’d originally thought I was in menopause, because the textbooks inform us that if we’ve missed a period for 12 months running in our fifties, chances are we’ve hit menopause. ......But, like you I’d had none of the hot and cold sweats, or mood changes etc either, so I too had assumed I was just having an easy time...........Turns out and after a blood test and to determine if I am in the menopause or not, I am not in menopause, but I am ‘borderline menopause’. So it was actually a period, which I’d known it was, because everything about it pointed to a period and I was told I might get another period too.
I am not sure why your doctor wouldn’t have taken a blood test to actually determine if you are in menopause or not. But you could always ask for one. Chances are, your age of 52, combined with no menopause symptoms and you are 100% this was a period, that you are like me, ‘borderline menopause’, but I’d still have a test to see if you are or not.

"its all very strange isn’t it. I mean here we are, going about our business thinking we are in menopause and those years of periods are over and then ‘wham’, a period out of the blue. I was literally taken aback, came online immediately and was horrified by things I was reading, then I found this website. It didn’t really stop me from worrying and panicking though. I was imagining all sorts and that knowing my luck I’d be one of those unlucky ones in the 10%........I was at same time, convinced this was definitely a period and not something more sinister. I began thinking, ‘Am I in menopause or not’, because while I thought I was, I’d never been tested. But I honestly thought I was, given no period for almost two and a half years. At the end of the day, we women go through 40 years of a monthly period, we know the signs/symptoms, etc, we know our own bodies, what is normal for us and what is not. Everything about this, smacked of a period, down to colour, smell, growing heavier on the second day, but subsiding by the fifth day and length of time it lasted, which for me was usually 5 to 7 days.......I was literally over the moon when the doctor told me I was ‘borderline’. I’d have been shocked, had she said anything different.......I was so happy, I was almost crying. Am pleased everything was fine for you too. I’m back in November though, to have a blood test done, to see if Im actually in menopause by then.

"Hi ladies! Have been following threads on here as I too had similar experience. This forum made me feel so much more relaxed, finding out just how common this was! On the 30th May this year I started bleeding after not having anything for just over two years. To say I was scared was an understatement! I struggled to eat and function, after going to my GP and was put on 2 week referal to the hospital. I received the appointment for the 11th June, (yesterday) which was only 11 days in total but those 11 days were, I think, the longest days ever! Thinking about it I had felt an ovulation pinch a couple of weeks prior to the bleeding and it was enough for me to become aware of the fact I hadn’t felt it for a couple of years. Anyway, had scan yesterday, she said all looked good. Lining only 3 mm thick and she could only see one ovary, saying other one could have shrunk or hiding behind the bowel. Hour later had gynecology appointment, she said all was fine but they had noticed a pocket of fluid at neck of womb. She went on to do her own internal scan thing with the picture on tv for me to see. Whatever the pocket of fluid was it had disappeared and she then went onto showing me the other ovary, which she said looked fine along with the other one! The moral to this story is things do turn out fine. After I told her of stress this year, one of my 17 year old twins getting knocked over on pedestrian crossing, then my mum having silent heart attack, then discovered she had cancer of the womb. My daughter then was admitted to hospital with quinsy at the same time my mum was there! To top it off my bleed started the day I took my mum to specialist cancer hospital! Gynecologist is adamant this was bought on by stress and nothing more! I know this is a long post but just want to put in as much reassurance for you ladies as I gained myself from this forum. I know you will still worry as I did but it just makes you feel a bit easier when you know it is NOT uncommon! X

"I'm 51. I haven't had a period in about a year and a half, then today...bam...woke up bleeding. Like some others that have posted, I haven't had the classic menopause symptoms, so I've kind of doubted I was there. I'm not overly worried...I can see that it happens to a lot of us. It feels just like a period, so I'll wait until it's over and call my doctor. Thanks for sharing so people like me can see it's not uncommon!
I'm more annoyed than worried...lol. Just a week ago, I began cleaning out my bathroom cabinets. I put all my leftover feminine hygiene products in a box to donate, bit it was still in the bathroom, thank goodness. Ugh.

"Just wanted to update everyone, I went for my hysteroscopy appt, lovely doctor and nurses really put me at ease, had trans vaginal scan, doctor was happy with results of that so decided I didn't need a hysteroscopy. Had a smear and bloods so waiting for results of those, but not concerned. Apparently I have a small cyst on my right ovary so have to go back for another scan in November, but doctor didn't seem to think it was anything to be concerned about. Feeling much more relaxed about it all - doctor thought my period was down to a spike in hormones and said it does happen sometimes.

"Sounds nearly identical to my result although I did get a hysteroscopy (as at 4.6 mm endometrium I was within the perameters for a hysteroscopy in the Scottish system but not the UK system). The doctors also mentioned a small cyst on my right ovary (although this was not mentioned on the consultants report) but I have not been advised of a follow up scan on this. I intend to query this with the doctors though when I next see them as from what I have seen on the internet there should be a follow up scan. I wonder whether the cyst was as a result of an ovulation/period and I am also convinced the 'period' was due to a hormone spike, in my case due to an episode of acute stress (which has now gone) particularly as I have suffered a lot more menopausal hot flushes in the months since so I figure there must be a hormone drop going on!

"So.......here I am yet again! Long story kinda short....2 years ago after no period for 13 months I got it. Had all the tests and everything was negative. 6 months ago in february I spotted for a day. Doctor once again did all the tests and said I was ok.
Yep...after a few weeks of pms symptoms ...just got my period again. I don't know what is going on and of course very concerned again. Trying very hard not to panic again.

"First time was just over a year after my last period. Second time was about six months later when I had the hysteroscopy. Third time was 16 months later. I can't believe you had no anaesthesia!!! Dr. Said first time around it looked like my ovary was trying to work. I had symptoms of getting a period. Second time probably a hormone surge suddenly. She said it's odd as I'm thin and often fat ladies get estrogen. Third time she said she thinks it was either due to dry vagina ( sorry) or very thin endometrial layer, which was very thin in the Ultrasound.

"See my previous threads. A very similar thing happened to me after 3 years with no periods. I had breast tenderness and then a typical period followed a couple of days later, stopping 4-5 days after it started. I too had a very stressful time about 6 weeks previously and am convinced that caused a estrogen or hormone spike leading to the period. I got checked out with hysteroscopy and biopsies with a normal result back in June. I have had no period since. Please do get things checked out but try not to stress too much in the meantime as it does sound like a hormone spike.

"I went to the doctor last Friday. Of course he his main concern was uterine cancer. I knew you would say that but it still scared me. He did a biopsy of the uterus and an exam. I do have a lot of fibroids but he doesn't think that is the cause of it. On Tuesday I go for a ultrasound internally of the uterus. He said we can go from there, don't worry. He did say everything will be okay and it could turn out to be nothing. I've been seeing him for years and I trust him. So no matter what I feel like I'm in good hands. But I can't get it out of my mind. And I'm still very scared.

"I hope everything went OK yesterday. I initially had an ultrasound and further investigations usually depend on the endometrium thickness. Mine was 4.6mm and so they did a hysteroscopy examination (camera in the womb) and biopsies of the womb there and then (this was in the UK but under the Scottish one-stop-shop procedure). At least it gives a result and reassurance immediately although the biopsy results take longer. The doctors have set procedures they need to follow under guidelines so try not to worry and not to read too much into anything.

"Hi Im 50 yrs old and after having a heavy 10 day bleed ‘period’ 2 years after my last one (with my usual normal period symptoms)
I became worried and visited my GP who booked me an internal scan,
3 weeks later I had the scan and my GP contacted me and told me I should urgently come in to see him as the results showed an endometrial lining of 12.4mm and that I have endometrial hyperplasia which now needs a biopsy carried out to rule our cancer (which he wrongly said to me at that time that I could have a 50/50 chance of having cancer)
I got a very quick appointment with a gynaecologist who told me it is actually just a 10% chance, which made me feel a bit better but I was still worried sick,
She took a biopsy there and then and told me the results could take up to 2 weeks,
Well the results actually took 3 weeks and that was with me making a few phone calls to chase them up and the results showed NO cancerous cells which was obviously a great relief,
I have a follow up appointment scan booked for 3 months time, I suppose to
check if the thickness of the lining has changed,
The reason I’m taking the time to post this is because when I was out of my mind with worry I found this website thread and it gave me hope that so many other women had also had bleeding so long after their last period,
which made me feel a lot better, also some ladies had not come back on to share their results so I wanted to let anyone else know that it’s not always the worst news,
And something else quite interesting was that before this bleed I was suffering the worst hot flushes and mood swings for around a year but they have now magically disappeared after the bleed, I hope it stays that way,
*But PLEASE get yourself checked out if you suffer one of these late bleeds as it mustn’t be ignored !

"Hi ladies,
I have been silently following this forum for the last 3 weeks, following going to the GP with my mum after she had some post menstrual bleeding which lasted up to 3 days. Prior to that she was experiencing pre period pains in her chest etc which she used to get when she used to have her periods. Anyways so we went to the GP three weeks ago with her symptoms and prior to this occasion she had bled before but never got this seen to. However during the consultation the GP told her she would need an urgent two week referral to gynaelogy to rule out cancer. This obviously scared me and I know deep down it scared my mum too. For the first couple days I was worried sick especially after googling her symptoms which all led to cancer. However I then came across this forum and literally read every single comment. The more and more I read the more reassured and comforted I was that this was 'normal'. So I thank the lady that started this forum as i can see that it has reassured so many women! 2 weeks on I went with my mum to the hospital today where she had a hysteroscopy and an ultrasound which they said looked healthy and fine. They also took a biopsy to be sure. So we are just waiting on the results from the biopsy.
So please for those who are worrying, please be reassured that this is very very common and your chances of cancer are very slim. Only 1 in 10 are there causes for concern.
I will update you all with the results from the biopsy but so far so good.
And thank you alllllll for helping me through this very difficult time. Remember our bodies are strange and sometimes things happen and there is no explanation. I guess we always wrongly assume the worse.
Don't spend time worrying until there comes a time when you need to! Xx

"last period 22 months ago. i am now 52 yo.
two weeks ago i started having the worst breast pain... more just the nipples. my clothes even hurt.
i remember thinking it was like during ovulation back when i had my periods.
fast forward to yesterday... home with a terrible cold and feeling like complete crp. i go to pee and find i have brown discharge.... then pink a little while later followed by some minimal red spotting. here it is Christmas Eve and I am freaking out.
not a full period.... just spotting thus far.
please pray for me... feeling overwhelmed as i have severe health anxiety.
here’s a question: how do we know if maybe we did spot or bleed slightly in the time of our last period and just didn’t notice it? For example when we get up in the middle of the night to urinate I don’t necessarily look very closely ... and doctors say that any spotting needs to be counted as blood and to start the count over for those 12 months. hope that makes sense.
it would have to happen over Christmas!

i have had all of that but only spotting.... no flow at all only minimally on toilet paper.
Just worried because like an idiot I started googling. BIG MISTAKE!

"Yes, if you see my previous posts earlier in the year I had sore breasts which were just like the PMT I used to get. I then had what was a text book period, for me. My scans and tests were all clear and I am convinced it was a period. I had been under some extreme stress and have read since this can alter hormones so could have caused it. As to spotting, my natural periods in my thirties were just spotting and a bit of brown discharge. At the end of the day the heaviness of a period just depends on the thickness of the womb lining. I wish you well with your appointment. Let us know how you got on.

The consultant laughed when I asked about any need for contraception (I had a baby at 40 years old and two miscarriages in the space of a year so I thought it was a fair question) so I guess he thought any eggs released had no chance of being viable (I was 53 at the time).

"Hi Claudia. I didn't get any spotting as such after sex but can't remember how long I left it after the colposcopy. I was one of the unlucky ones and the colposcopy was very painful for me and I had bleeding and later a discoloured discharge for at least 9 days after so it unlikely I had sex in that time frame. Could it be old stuff being cleared out - would be more of a discharge if so. I also had slight stomach cramps/discomfort for about 3 weeks so don't worry if this happens to you. Another thought is that I think it was exactly 4 weeks after the start of your last bleed. If that was a period could this be another one starting? If the bleed was just a few random spots which stopped could it be localised external irritation? Let me know how you are getting on but if worried please go and have a chat with your doctor.

"Hi, I can sympathise with your stress as I went through something similar 8 months ago (see my previous posts). I was 53 and had no periods for 3 years. I then had what seemed to be a period (with usual pre-menstruation symptoms) and was given the all clear following investigations. Please do try not to panic, the average age for menopause is 51 (so you were on the earlier side) and it is officially classified as having no periods for 12 months. Until then doctors will not investigate into any bleeding. I know of someone who went 11 months and then had a bleed so the clock had to be re-started for the 12 month period and I believe that it is not unusual for that to happen. You are only 3 months outside the magic 12 month mark and please take comfort (as I did) from the fact that the bleed stopped. If it came and went like a period it probably was one - they describe them as 'rogue' periods. I was convinced mine was a period and investigations did not prove otherwise. I had an accute period of stress and I believe (and have read) that this can cause fluctuations in hormones - I believe that was the cause of my 'rogue' period. As mentioned, please try not to stress, remember you are doing the right thing and as much as you can to get things checked out as soon as you can and you can do no more. Any investigations, even without symptoms, are worrying but they are there as a precautionary measure (on the NHS I had two types of scan - an external womb one and trans-vaginal scan and then based on the thickness of the womb lining, a hysteroscopy which will be the pipelle one you mentioned). I am sure all will go well. Please post again to update and give others the re-assurance this forum provides.

The other option was to be sent off for it to be done under a GA. I told her to just ignore my yelps and please try. (the thought of all this waiting dragging out was unbearable). she finally managed to do it and hopefully got a good enough sample. So now waiting on smear and biopsy results. She did a pelvic exam and said everything felt fine.
2 days I had an ultrasound and a transvaginal ultrasound. i now have no modesty left. The radiologist said everything appeared normal to her and her opinion is, if there is any cancer we have caught it early. She sent the results to my doctor on Friday and I haven't heard anything so I am guessing doctor is waiting for biopsy results.

Had results back this week and polyp is benign 😃
Gynecologist/surgeon thinks my hormones were just giving off a final surge.
So relieved. At the beginning of it all, after googling, I had almost booked my funeral. So upshot is menstrual bleeding post menopause isn't always a sign of something sinister but get it checked out!

"Hi, Claudia. Have you considered whether the spotting is from a 'localised' source. I often get some skin irritation after intercourse which results in a little fresh red/pink spotting on toilet tissue when wiping straight after. The spotting does not continue, after this however. If it seems to come from a higher up source then could it be cervical erosion? Also are your pap smear tests up to date?

It turned out to be fibroids on the outside of my uterus. Go get your family dr. to get you an appt. It happens alot more then people think. Let me know how you make out.

"Wow I am SO glad to find this website... actually stumbled on it while frantically searching for a reason I could be getting my period after 2 years without one... I'm 47 and thought I went through menopause since no period... of course before finding this site Google diagnosed me with several different types of cancer... now after reading how normal post menopausal bleeding can be I'm calmer but still going to make an appointment on Monday

"Glad to help and provide some comfort. I am convinced mine was just a normal period caused by a hormone spike due to a time of accute stress (classic signs and investigations came back clear). It is always wise to get it properly checked out though and you are doing the right thing. Best wishes.

"Hello lovely ladies of this forum...For the past 2 months l have been following your posts...reading & then re-reading them which really helped keep me sane!....l am 54 yrs old & 3 yrs Post Menopausal...At the end of July,l had a bleed overnight with clots which l believed to have come from my uterus...was referred under the fast track system for a Transvaginal Scan...this resulted in finding a large 3cm polyp, a large fibroid & several smaller fibroids...Next came the Hysteroscopy with Polypectomy & fibroid removal...also had uterine & vaginal biopsies...My anxiety was extreme to say the least...l was so very scared of all the actual procedures & the fear of the unknown...l went through some very dark days overthinking but in the end l tried to tell myself whilst waiting, not to stress over things that i could'nt control, l had done my bit!...Biopsy results showed nothing sinister, although l do have both Vaginal & Endometrial Atrophy for which l'll have to see my G.P. l think?!...this will be my next step...maybe needing oestrogen cream & oral progesterone hormone...but in the meantime, l have started to use Almond Oil during the day & Yes O.B. at night plus Hydromol as a barrier ( for stinging urine) to help myself out whilst trying to figure out what to do next!...My message to anyone going through this is...Please take that first step & go & see your G.P. to get the bleeding checked out...lt has been a very scary journey & l'm not quite out of the woods yet!!...
l'd like to say a heartfelt thank you to each & everyone of the brave & courageous ladies for sharing your stories...l'm so glad l found this forum...l'm also so thankful to the U.K. N.H.S ...from the bleed to biopsy results took 2 months & 1 week!...One last word of advice...try not to Google too much!!!...instead give your trust over to the Professionals who are there to help...l hope my post helps in some small way anyone who is going through this process right now...
Finally, thank you for taking the time out to read this...l'd like to stick around & help out with any worries or concerns if l can
Best wishes & positive thoughts to you all xx
