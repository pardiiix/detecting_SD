A group of us worked out reduction schemes individually that have allowed us to reduce far further than ever before but they are all basically the same - and they were based on a scheme a Swedish gentleman worked out when he simply couldn't get below 3mg without pain. Img at that level is 33%, 1/2mg is 17% - way above the 10% that has been recommended for years. So he used table to see the daily doses and took the new dose on one day, old dose for a few days and then proceeded by repeating that and then reducing the number of days of old dose - until he got to everyday new dose. It worked, he got off pred and has been off pred for at least 3 years (it could be longer). Something similar to mine is being tried by a consultant rheumatologist in the north of England and he too finds it works for every single patient he has given it to. As it did for several ladies beforehand.
My reductions are VERY slow. I use the following pattern to reduce each 1mg:
1 day new dose, 6 days old dose
1 day new dose, 5 days old dose
1 day new dose, 4 days old dose
1 day new dose, 3 days old dose
1 day new dose, 2 days old dose
1 day new dose, 1 day old dose
1 day old dose, 2 days new dose
1 day old dose, 3 days new dose
1 day old dose, 4 days new dose
1 day old dose, 5 days new dose
1 day old dose, 6 days new dose
By that stage if I feel OK I feel safe to go all new dose. I suppose you might be OK starting and stopping at ""1 day new, 4 days old"" but I was terribly sensitive to steroid withdrawal pain so I err on the safe side. Once you get to the ""everyday new dose"" - if you feel OK you can start on the next reduction, no real need to spend a month at the new dose.
This avoids steroid withdrawal pain - which is so similar to PMR pain that you often can't tell which is which and some of us suspect that many flares are NOT the PMR returning but problems with steroid withdrawal.

When you are at doses below 5mg it is a good idea to rest at each new dose for a month at least before trying the next reduction.

My reply was:
No - you go back to the last dose that worked well immediately and stop the reduction. This isn't a ""flare"", this is your body telling you that you have got to the dose you are looking for: the LOWEST DOSE THAT MANAGES THE SYMPTOMS. It doesn't mean you won't get lower, it just means not yet. However slowly you reduce, whatever scheme you use, you will not get below that dose without a return of symptoms because of left-over inflammation that hasn't been removed by the amount of pred you took.

"My dad has been dealing with a horrible case of PMR and GCA since last June, but diagnosed in August. He started out at at 60 mg... only down to 40 right now. We've been trying to taper slowly, but his flares are horrible. The rheumatologists in his area are few and far between and negligent at best. On the last doc's watch, dad diagnosed with heart failure and then severe osteoporosis, only diagnosed after 5 vertebrae fractures. I'm trying to figure out if the DSNS approach is how to reduce from such a high dosage or if you do this once you get down lower? Any advice is appreciated. This has been a nighmare.

"Hello
​Ive been on prednisolone for 4 years now Im down to 5mg but struggling to get lower. Am I right in thinking the theory is to do the slow method to 41/2 mg then stay on this a month and then start again if ok. Could do with some advice.

"When you say you are struggling does that mean you are in pain? If so, has that been just recently? Did it follow your latest reduction?
You are down to a low dose and a stage that has given many of us trouble. I stayed there for three months as directed by GP and only tried to get lower if I was completely comfortable.
Also it is often recommended that you do not reduce by more than 10% so that means cutting your pills ( as long as they are not the coated ones ). Alternatively you can reduce in tiny steps by perhaps reducing to the next level on alternate days or spacing the reductions even less frequently.... as one day a week then the lower dose twice a week and so on.
You may not find this necessary but what is essential is not to reduce while in pain because you'll only find yourself back on a higher dose.
It took me five years but I did get there and have been symptom free for more than three years. Good luck!

"Hi Emis I am going to try reducing but am starting from 25mg. Every time I try to reduce to 20mg the pain comes back. Today I got some 1mg tablets so hope to start the slow reduction process. It is going to take a long time but at the moment I am not getting away from 25 anyway. Are many people starting from such a high dose? It sounds impossible to get down under 10mg. It would be good to hear if anyone starting a 1mg reduction from 25 did get down to a very small dose.

"I began at 20MG and reduced 2.5MG per month. (For example, 17.5MG second month, 15MG third month, 12.5MG fourth month, 10MG fifth month - January 2017).
February 2017 I will take 9MG, March 2017 I will take 8MG. Doc prescribes 5MG pills and 1MG pills. So February I take one 5MG and four 2MG tablets daily. So far no flares. I am just waiting for the other shoe to drop though.

"I have been on Prednisolone since 2007 since my GP diagnosed my aching legs and arms due to PMR. Initially on 15mg dose the pains disappeared quickly and after a month I was down to 10mg. After 12 months this was deduced to 7.5 then after a year to 5mg. I have been trying to get the dose down since then. In September last year I was on 4mg and appart from a little acid reflux I was in no serious discomfort with minor stiffness. This year I have been making more effort to reduce my dependance on Prednisolone, and reduced to 3mg. I had a bone scan and was diagnosed with Osteopenea, my GP put me on Adcal vitamin D3 and calcium. I reduced Prednisolone to 2mg but the PMR symptoms came back with a vengence. I have had severe body stiffness in legs and upper arms and hands, and been feeling very weak but have tried to do as much exercise as possible walking mainly. The stiffness in back arms and legs is worse first thing in the morning for an hour or two. Taking Paracetamol helps to aleviate the pains. I am reluctant to go back on a higher dose of Prednisolone but may have to go up to 4mg. I am seeing my GP next week to discuss.

"If you were comfortable on 3mgs. I think I'd stay there or even, if necessary, increase up to 5 to have decent quality of life. Lots of us have found 5 a bit of a sticking point and several are happy to stay there for life if necessary.. Ten years may feel like a life sentence especially if, like me, you are not keen on drugs but so is the pain of PMR a life sentence, isn't it?
Perhaps your GP may have his/her reasons for wanting you to continue reducing but you are already on a low dose so they'd have to be convincing.
You'll get plenty more input from others, I'm sure.
Please let us know how you get on and best of luck.

"Hello,
Thank you for your reply. I am fortunate I have a sympathetic GP who has already said I may need to remain on a low dose of steride. The main concern comes from the female doctors concerned about osteoperosis and kidney damage. However I am now taking the Adcal tbs which should be beneficial to the bones. Appart from the stiffness I feel OK and at 77yrs that cant be bad.

Glad you're happy with your GP as I was with mine. They do worry about the bone thinning with age and steroids, I know. I was not able to take the bisphosphonate Alendronic Acid and just had calceos but when I had a total hip replacement four years ago aged 81 the surgeon said that I had ""amazing bone density for my age"" so obviously bone problems are not inevitable.
Also, I have a cyst on one kidney which is monitored twice a year. This is of at least four years standing and all normal so far. Hope that is encouraging and that all goes well for you.

"Have had PMR for 1 year 2 months. Began at 20 mg. Have faithfully followed DSNS method to the letter from about 9 mg level on. It really works for me. Have never missed a dose. I chart it out on paper for a month at a time, and put the pills in the little week-at-a-time plastic containers.
I have never met another person - in person - who has PMR either. I have more up days than down. I volunteer at the local USO and will soon begin volunteering at the local elementary school library. I retired from teaching 6th grade science about 3 years ago. We still like to travel, but we have moderated plans and locations a lot.
I was in bed so much the first couple of months, but I have driven myself to get up and out!! It would be easier to stay in bed!
I owe my current health level to a wonderful husband, understanding Rheumy Doc, obstinate adherence to to dosing method, and God's blessings for today??

"Just a note about a very important aspect of prednisone. When I had my first atack of PMR, the MD started me on a 60mg/day dose of prednisone. That was a year ago, and brought my pain to a halt quickly.
I have been trying to get to zero dose ever since. Once, at around 20mg/day, I noted that I awoke with a swollen and painful wrist back again. It continued, so I presumed that Rx was wearing off too early from the previous morning, so I started taking my prednisone at bedtime. It seemed to work.
I'm now at 5mg/day but cannot stay at 2.5mg/day. I just read in a medical column in the newspaper, a doctor mentioned, in a response to the body's ability to make cortisone, that it should resume, unless you're taking 5/mg at night.
My MD confirmed the fact and said that prednisone is designed to be taken in the morning, to coincide with the body's natural cortisone function. My pill box only said ""once a day"".
I'm now reducing on the morning schedule and hope that I haven't done irreperable damage to my endocrine system.
I hope this helps others and welcome anyone with information.

"Very interesting indeed. Many people on the forum play with different dosages at different times as they find out what works for them. I do feel that if taking pred at the wrong time impacted critically on our endocrine system it would be flagged up by the health service or in the accompanying leaflet. Hope the switch to morning pills works out for you. Getting down to 5mg a day and coping is a pretty good achievement!

"Thanks Celia.Although the pill bottle just says once a day, the insert says to take it before 9:00am. Just to add more confusion, one brand's insert says that it has a 4 hour time delay before releasing. I've asked the pharmacist to research it, and she'll call me back tomorrow. Stay tuned.

"After three flares between 8 to 6 mg I'm now reducing by the slow method by half a mg., But stopping at the point of one low dose one higher dose and staying at the low dose for three weeks, this I calculate will take me 98 weeks to zero preds. But never mind I'm approaching 7 mgs with no flare, we need someone to be following all our trails, any PHD students want a challenge. I have kept a record of daily doses for the last 18 months.

"Copied from Eileen's post in another discussion.
A group of us worked out reduction schemes individually that have allowed us to reduce far further than ever before but they are all basically the same - and they were based on a scheme a Swedish gentleman worked out when he simply couldn't get below 3mg without pain. Img at that level is 33%, 1/2mg is 17% - way above the 10% that has been recommended for years. So he used table to see the daily doses and took the new dose on one day, old dose for a few days and then proceeded by repeating that and then reducing the number of days of old dose - until he got to everyday new dose. It worked, he got off pred and has been off pred for at least 3 years (it could be longer). Something similar to mine is being tried by a consultant rheumatologist in the north of England and he too finds it works for every single patient he has given it to. As it did for several ladies beforehand.
My reductions are VERY slow. I use the following pattern to reduce each 1mg:
1 day new dose, 6 days old dose
1 day new dose, 5 days old dose
1 day new dose, 4 days old dose
1 day new dose, 3 days old dose
1 day new dose, 2 days old dose
1 day new dose, 1 day old dose
1 day old dose, 2 days new dose
1 day old dose, 3 days new dose
1 day old dose, 4 days new dose
1 day old dose, 5 days new dose
1 day old dose, 6 days new dose
By that stage if I feel OK I feel safe to go all new dose. I suppose you might be OK starting and stopping at ""1 day new, 4 days old"" but I was terribly sensitive to steroid withdrawal pain so I err on the safe side. Once you get to the ""everyday new dose"" - if you feel OK you can start on the next reduction, no real need to spend a month at the new dose.
This avoids steroid withdrawal pain - which is so similar to PMR pain that you often can't tell which is which and some of us suspect that many flares are NOT the PMR returning but problems with steroid withdrawal. Using a scheme like this also means you can stop immediately if you have any problems - you might be fine at one day old dose, 2 days new (lower) dose but not at a 3 day gap - but you have dropped your dose a lot and that is the idea. It also isn't as slow as you would think - you can reduce at a rate of about 1mg/month on a continual basis.
The Bristol group start new patients with PMR with 6 weeks 15mg, 6 weeks at 12.5mg and then a year at 10mg before continuing the reduction and that achieves a far lower rate of flare (20% instead of 60%) and I suspect their flares then come below 10mg as they then do the 1mg at a time reduction. Just below 10mg is a common dose for people to get stuck at - and I (and others) believe it is because even 10% drops are too much for many patients. These patients are then labelled as ""steroid resistant"" or told they need methotrexate to help them reduce but we have seen this slow reduction work for those patients too. We believe that methotrexate (MTX) works for patients who have late onset rheumatoid arthritis (LORA) or LORA and PMR together. Very few patients get off pred altogether when taking the MTX - those who do are probably the mis-diagnosed LORA patients - or another arthritis that responds to MTX.""
Further comment from Eileen in original discussion:
Can I add a codicil to the very slow reduction plan in the above post:
When you are at doses below 5mg it is a good idea to rest at each new dose for a month at least before trying the next reduction. At this point you risk overshooting the dose that is controlling the inflammation so waiting a short time to see if symptoms reappear is helpful. If you just continue there is a possibility that you get to very slightly below the ""right dose"" and inflammation will start to reappear very slowly. The blood tests will lag even further behind the dose reduction - there must be enough inflammation to increases the proteins being measured for the blood tests to rise.
Someone has asked this question:
""I'm at 7mg going down to 6mg, and I'm at the point where I'm starting to shift from more 6mg than 7mg, but I can tell the pain is returning. So...do I jump up big to say 10mg, or try 7mg or 8mg? I hate the very idea of going up at all, but it is what it is.""
My reply was:
No - you go back to the last dose that worked well immediately and stop the reduction. This isn't a ""flare"", this is your body telling you that you have got to the dose you are looking for: the LOWEST DOSE THAT MANAGES THE SYMPTOMS. It doesn't mean you won't get lower, it just means not yet. However slowly you reduce, whatever scheme you use, you will not get below that dose without a return of symptoms because of left-over inflammation that hasn't been removed by the amount of pred you took. It is if you ignore these warnings that you will allow a build-up of the inflammation to the stage where you will have a flare on your hands.
To comment on something someone else said - you have differentiated between steroid withdrawal and a return of symptoms by using DSNS. If you were going to suffer with steroid withdrawal you will notice it the first day you use the new lower dose. That is the idea of DSNS - you go back to the dose your body is happy at for a few days and then show the new dose to your body again. For me it usually takes about 3 times for my body to accept the new lower dose and stop complaining.

"I have been doing a little research, and have found that it is very important to take the prednisone in the AM. Our Adrenals begin their work early in the AM and we need to mimic the Adrenals with our meds.
I am down to 5 mg from 20 mg using the DSNS method shared above. Thanks to my husband, I have never missed a dose. I have mapped out every dose by date... down to 0 mg in a small notebook, and now I fill one of my five small weekly pill containers with pills for one week (I do a month worth at a time). My Rheumy says the Adrenals normally produce about 7.4 mg of cortisol, so the fact that I have had no flare so far is a pretty good indication that my Adrenals are functioning.
My next question- we are going to Florence, Italy for 2 weeks in December- there is a 5 hour time difference. If I take the prednisone at the same USA time every day (6:30 AM USA is 11:30 AM ITALY) is that early enough in the day? If I switch to 6:30 AM Italy time, that is 1:30 AM USA time. Is that too early? I don't want a flare now because of the time change!!!
The day we return is my first 3 mg dose, followed by six days of 4 mg again.

"I think for the majority taking Pred. in the morning is right but it was not for me. When I complained of the over hyped rapid pulse semi panic feeling that followed within two or three hours of taking my steroids, my GP said to try taking them at 9.00 PM instead. To my delight and his interest it worked and I remember him saying "" I'll note that for future reference"". I continued to take them at night until I got to zero and the unwanted symptoms did not return. It did not affect my sleep.

Got relief at night although I’m not one of the lucky ones, I’m never ever pain free. Went back down to 7 this morning. Then will pick up where I left off on the dsns reduction to 6.5.

"I'm brand new here so I'm probably not following the correct protocol. I have been on prednisone for 3 years starting I think on 50 mg and was until today on just 2 mg with no pain UNTIL my son died 2 weeks ago, and today I'm in pain ALL OVER. I have a regularly scheduled doctor's visit in a couple of weeks, but I believe I've figured out that prednisone is in my case due to stress. When I first began prednisone because of all-over pain, my son had just been diagnosed with a terminal disease. Now, as I said, I am way down to just 2 mg a day and today the all-over pain came back and - guess what - most extreme stress ever in my life now with my precious son dying. I had taken 2 mg this morning and with the pain this afternoon just took an additional 2 mg. We'll see, Thanks.

"Jenny, sorry to hear about the tiredness. Fortunately, my tiredness disappeared after the diagnosis and I began taking 20mg/day of Prednisone. I was so tired for the previous 2 months before diagnosis,I could not exercise. One morning, I could not move literally. I was paralyzed and lying in bed.
After a visit to the doctor and 11 blood test for everything from , Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, PMR was diagnosed by my doctor.
He put me on 20mg and said to call him in 3 hours, if the pain was subsiding quite a bit he had made the correct diagnosis.The regimen was 20 mg for a month, then to 15mg. After seeing a RA specialist here in the US, she reduce me to 10 mg/day for a month then 9 and now on 8mg/day for a month. Her plan is to reduce me by 1mg/ month until I can hopefully come of the Prednisone completely. Blood test are taken on every monthly visit. Coming off Prednisone at a faster rate can cause problems unrelated to PMR.
I have a bit of stiffness in my left hand, but that is all. I am still playing golf and back to the YMCA daily.
I hope this helps. It has been an interesting battle that at 60, and very active, did not expect to see.
best of luck

"Copied from Eileen's post in another discussion.
A group of us worked out reduction schemes individually that have allowed us to reduce far further than ever before but they are all basically the same - and they were based on a scheme a Swedish gentleman worked out when he simply couldn't get below 3mg without pain. Img at that level is 33%, 1/2mg is 17% - way above the 10% that has been recommended for years. So he used table to see the daily doses and took the new dose on one day, old dose for a few days and then proceeded by repeating that and then reducing the number of days of old dose - until he got to everyday new dose. It worked, he got off pred and has been off pred for at least 3 years (it could be longer). Something similar to mine is being tried by a consultant rheumatologist in the north of England and he too finds it works for every single patient he has given it to. As it did for several ladies beforehand.
My reductions are VERY slow. I use the following pattern to reduce each 1mg:
1 day new dose, 6 days old dose
1 day new dose, 5 days old dose
1 day new dose, 4 days old dose
1 day new dose, 3 days old dose
1 day new dose, 2 days old dose
1 day new dose, 1 day old dose
1 day old dose, 2 days new dose
1 day old dose, 3 days new dose
1 day old dose, 4 days new dose
1 day old dose, 5 days new dose
1 day old dose, 6 days new dose
By that stage if I feel OK I feel safe to go all new dose. I suppose you might be OK starting and stopping at ""1 day new, 4 days old"" but I was terribly sensitive to steroid withdrawal pain so I err on the safe side. Once you get to the ""everyday new dose"" - if you feel OK you can start on the next reduction, no real need to spend a month at the new dose.
This avoids steroid withdrawal pain - which is so similar to PMR pain that you often can't tell which is which and some of us suspect that many flares are NOT the PMR returning but problems with steroid withdrawal. Using a scheme like this also means you can stop immediately if you have any problems - you might be fine at one day old dose, 2 days new (lower) dose but not at a 3 day gap - but you have dropped your dose a lot and that is the idea. It also isn't as slow as you would think - you can reduce at a rate of about 1mg/month on a continual basis.
The Bristol group start new patients with PMR with 6 weeks 15mg, 6 weeks at 12.5mg and then a year at 10mg before continuing the reduction and that achieves a far lower rate of flare (20% instead of 60%) and I suspect their flares then come below 10mg as they then do the 1mg at a time reduction. Just below 10mg is a common dose for people to get stuck at - and I (and others) believe it is because even 10% drops are too much for many patients. These patients are then labelled as ""steroid resistant"" or told they need methotrexate to help them reduce but we have seen this slow reduction work for those patients too. We believe that methotrexate (MTX) works for patients who have late onset rheumatoid arthritis (LORA) or LORA and PMR together. Very few patients get off pred altogether when taking the MTX - those who do are probably the mis-diagnosed LORA patients - or another arthritis that responds to MTX.""
Further comment from Eileen in original discussion:
Can I add a codicil to the very slow reduction plan in the above post:
When you are at doses below 5mg it is a good idea to rest at each new dose for a month at least before trying the next reduction. At this point you risk overshooting the dose that is controlling the inflammation so waiting a short time to see if symptoms reappear is helpful. If you just continue there is a possibility that you get to very slightly below the ""right dose"" and inflammation will start to reappear very slowly. The blood tests will lag even further behind the dose reduction - there must be enough inflammation to increases the proteins being measured for the blood tests to rise.
Someone has asked this question:
""I'm at 7mg going down to 6mg, and I'm at the point where I'm starting to shift from more 6mg than 7mg, but I can tell the pain is returning. So...do I jump up big to say 10mg, or try 7mg or 8mg? I hate the very idea of going up at all, but it is what it is.""
My reply was:
No - you go back to the last dose that worked well immediately and stop the reduction. This isn't a ""flare"", this is your body telling you that you have got to the dose you are looking for: the LOWEST DOSE THAT MANAGES THE SYMPTOMS. It doesn't mean you won't get lower, it just means not yet. However slowly you reduce, whatever scheme you use, you will not get below that dose without a return of symptoms because of left-over inflammation that hasn't been removed by the amount of pred you took. It is if you ignore these warnings that you will allow a build-up of the inflammation to the stage where you will have a flare on your hands.
To comment on something someone else said - you have differentiated between steroid withdrawal and a return of symptoms by using DSNS. If you were going to suffer with steroid withdrawal you will notice it the first day you use the new lower dose. That is the idea of DSNS - you go back to the dose your body is happy at for a few days and then show the new dose to your body again. For me it usually takes about 3 times for my body to accept the new lower dose and stop complaining.

Most of us have reached sticking point(s) at some stage, usually before getting to 3. After several set backs my GP told me to stay on 10 for three months.
Not qualified to prescribe, of course, but from my and others' experience I would say go back to 5 and if that works, fine; If not, increase it until you do feel comfortable. If the bloods show raised markers then you'll be sure you need a higher dose for a bit. Unfortunately, sometimes the markers do not reflect the increased inflammation.

"Hello all, very interesting looking at the various experiences. So, here's mine. Diagnosed with PMR (but no GCA!) last September. SED rate was over 130. So bad it kicked an elevated heart enzyme, and they first thought I had a mild heart attack. Luckily, doctors diagnosed the PMR in about 2 weeks. Lost about 25 lbs. in that short time. Started with a huge injection of Pred, then to 40 to 20 to 10 tablets. Since then, we gone down 1 per month, and I'm at 6. Once I go to 5, they will slow it down even more by going down 1 every 2-3 months. So far, so good. Hard to distinguish any muscle pain or stiffness with physical activity - like going to the gym, etc. From this discussion, it sounds like I will really find out where I am with this when I get under 5mg. Although, the slow rate they're taking through may be the best approach. Also, take calcium and D supplements. All blood work looks good. Weight gain is very frustrating... When people say debilitating, I totally get it! Worst illness experience ever. I'm pretty pain tolerant - but this was horrible...

"Copied from Eileen's post in another discussion.
A group of us worked out reduction schemes individually that have allowed us to reduce far further than ever before but they are all basically the same - and they were based on a scheme a Swedish gentleman worked out when he simply couldn't get below 3mg without pain. Img at that level is 33%, 1/2mg is 17% - way above the 10% that has been recommended for years. So he used table to see the daily doses and took the new dose on one day, old dose for a few days and then proceeded by repeating that and then reducing the number of days of old dose - until he got to everyday new dose. It worked, he got off pred and has been off pred for at least 3 years (it could be longer). Something similar to mine is being tried by a consultant rheumatologist in the north of England and he too finds it works for every single patient he has given it to. As it did for several ladies beforehand.
My reductions are VERY slow. I use the following pattern to reduce each 1mg:
1 day new dose, 6 days old dose
1 day new dose, 5 days old dose
1 day new dose, 4 days old dose
1 day new dose, 3 days old dose
1 day new dose, 2 days old dose
1 day new dose, 1 day old dose
1 day old dose, 2 days new dose
1 day old dose, 3 days new dose
1 day old dose, 4 days new dose
1 day old dose, 5 days new dose
1 day old dose, 6 days new dose
By that stage if I feel OK I feel safe to go all new dose. I suppose you might be OK starting and stopping at ""1 day new, 4 days old"" but I was terribly sensitive to steroid withdrawal pain so I err on the safe side. Once you get to the ""everyday new dose"" - if you feel OK you can start on the next reduction, no real need to spend a month at the new dose.
This avoids steroid withdrawal pain - which is so similar to PMR pain that you often can't tell which is which and some of us suspect that many flares are NOT the PMR returning but problems with steroid withdrawal. Using a scheme like this also means you can stop immediately if you have any problems - you might be fine at one day old dose, 2 days new (lower) dose but not at a 3 day gap - but you have dropped your dose a lot and that is the idea. It also isn't as slow as you would think - you can reduce at a rate of about 1mg/month on a continual basis.
The Bristol group start new patients with PMR with 6 weeks 15mg, 6 weeks at 12.5mg and then a year at 10mg before continuing the reduction and that achieves a far lower rate of flare (20% instead of 60%) and I suspect their flares then come below 10mg as they then do the 1mg at a time reduction. Just below 10mg is a common dose for people to get stuck at - and I (and others) believe it is because even 10% drops are too much for many patients. These patients are then labelled as ""steroid resistant"" or told they need methotrexate to help them reduce but we have seen this slow reduction work for those patients too. We believe that methotrexate (MTX) works for patients who have late onset rheumatoid arthritis (LORA) or LORA and PMR together. Very few patients get off pred altogether when taking the MTX - those who do are probably the mis-diagnosed LORA patients - or another arthritis that responds to MTX.""
Further comment from Eileen in original discussion:
Can I add a codicil to the very slow reduction plan in the above post:
When you are at doses below 5mg it is a good idea to rest at each new dose for a month at least before trying the next reduction. At this point you risk overshooting the dose that is controlling the inflammation so waiting a short time to see if symptoms reappear is helpful. If you just continue there is a possibility that you get to very slightly below the ""right dose"" and inflammation will start to reappear very slowly. The blood tests will lag even further behind the dose reduction - there must be enough inflammation to increases the proteins being measured for the blood tests to rise.
Someone has asked this question:
""I'm at 7mg going down to 6mg, and I'm at the point where I'm starting to shift from more 6mg than 7mg, but I can tell the pain is returning. So...do I jump up big to say 10mg, or try 7mg or 8mg? I hate the very idea of going up at all, but it is what it is.""
My reply was:
No - you go back to the last dose that worked well immediately and stop the reduction. This isn't a ""flare"", this is your body telling you that you have got to the dose you are looking for: the LOWEST DOSE THAT MANAGES THE SYMPTOMS. It doesn't mean you won't get lower, it just means not yet. However slowly you reduce, whatever scheme you use, you will not get below that dose without a return of symptoms because of left-over inflammation that hasn't been removed by the amount of pred you took. It is if you ignore these warnings that you will allow a build-up of the inflammation to the stage where you will have a flare on your hands.
To comment on something someone else said - you have differentiated between steroid withdrawal and a return of symptoms by using DSNS. If you were going to suffer with steroid withdrawal you will notice it the first day you use the new lower dose. That is the idea of DSNS - you go back to the dose your body is happy at for a few days and then show the new dose to your body again. For me it usually takes about 3 times for my body to accept the new lower dose and stop complaining.

"Hi,
This is an interesting discussion and one that I probable should have applied to myself. My inflammation, which is measured by: Erythrocyte Sediment Rate was in February 24mm when on 3mg of Prednislone. I had no feelings of pain or stiffness, this only occurred on 1mg. Since finishing it has increased to 27mm. So in theory I should re introduce the Pred to 3mg and then apply the slow taper

"Hi
This topic is very interesting and I would be very interested in doing this method but one thing worries me.....I have read lots of posts on this forum and other forums for FMR/GCA where people are upping and lowering their doses of Pred, are they doing this with their Rheumy's/GP's knowledge and agreement or are they doing it by themselves?
I am seeing my Rheumy in a weeks time and will ask her about this method as I have gotten down to 12.5mg from 20mg but the symptoms returned almost immediately so I went back up to 15mg every other day and this seems to work (even though I don't like doing it without GP/Rheumy backing), I don't think that it is withdrawal from the Pred causing the symptoms though. Hopefully she will agree that this method will be of benefit to me so that I can try it at least, I'm not sure what I'll do if she doesn't because I don't think I could put up with the pain it's causing (I'm disabled and am in pain 24/7 because of it so any extra pain makes life pretty hard to say the least!)

"It would be wise for you to copy and paste your question into a new post as this will only be seen by a very few people followng the old thread. If the symptoms returned immediately they could have been withdrawal, but a drop of 2.5 makes it difficult to know exactly how much more you may need. Are you taking 12.5 one day and 15 in between? Are you able to get 1 mg tablets, it makes it easier to drop in smaller steps.

"Hi Anhaga
Thanks for replying, I do understand that only people following this post will see it but as my post is related to the OP I thought it best to post here. I do see your point though and as I have also said about changing dosages of Pred I should post a new topic regarding this.
To answer your question, yes I am taking 12.5mg one day and 15mg the next and so on. I could probably get 1mg tablets if I asked my GP but knowing him he will probably read me the riot act (in a nice way) for meddling with the dosage without talking to him or my Rheumy! lol As I said in my last post, I'm due to see my Rheumy soon so will take it up with her.
Because I was already disabled when I was diagnosed with FMR it's hard to know what is causing the pain in the first place, and now I have been diagnosed with Pulmonary Fibrosis which also causes pain it really is hard to know which of the 3 is causing the most pain and when. Phew, it doesn't rain but pours eh!!! :-)

"I was on 20mg of Prednisone to begin. Stayed there about a month. Then I began the DSNS method with my Rheumy’s approval. I never missed a dose and dropped all the way down to 3mg before I thought some pain was returning. He said that in his experience, 3 or 4 mg is about the spot for trouble if one is going to have any. My Rheumy was adamant about only going back up to the LEAST possible dose that would stop the pain. I only went up 2mg and resumed the DSNS method from that level. I had PMR from June 2016 to June 2018. I think this method allowed my adrenals to resume working slowly while controlling the pain. Knock on wood, I am still pain free. My Rheumy monitored my blood work every 3 months. The SED rate, and the other one I can’t recall right now, fell slowly and steadily back to normal. He did a bone scan in 2017 and again in 2018. I had no bone loss! Which is amazing for my age, 67. I went to OsteoStrong, osteogenic loading, weekly and took Vitamin D3 and calcium supplements throughout. I had no other diseases or disorders other than PMR. There, I think you have it all. Always follow your Doctor’s advice??

"I'm sorry to hear this. Wouldn't prednisone also help the pulmonary fibrosis, however? In which case maybe it's too soon to be tapering at all, let alone by these large steps. But I really don't know, I have no medical training, but maybe a question to ask the doctor.

"If you are concerned about changing your dose without the knowledge of your rheumy., what I do is contact his/her office, and leave a message regarding what I have done and why. Then if they are unhappy with what you are doing they can call you or give you an appointment to go in. I have not had any problems with this and have perhaps done it twice in one year.

"Do be VERY careful. I managed to get to 7 mg, thought I had a real victory. Had a bit of very minor surgery, did not increase my dosage, a few days later started to feel really bad! No energy, hard to breath, racing heart, nearly fainting...just a host of terrible symptoms. hospital emergency room four times in three weeks, No one...not the rheumatologist, the cardiologist, the nuerologist or my primary gerontologist could figure out the problem. Finally went to an endocrinologist and she quickly said I had adrenal insufficiency from coming off the prednisone too quickly after the surgery. I doubled my dose and within two days was almost back to normal. I'm trying hard to get back down, reducing the dosage by 1/2 mg every two weeks, Good luck to you all.

such a surprise that none of the docs.. not the internist, rheumatoligist, gerontologist, cardiologist, Er doc, gastro guy... none if them could figure out why I kept crashing . finally i went to an endochronologist and she diagnosed me within five minures with adrenal insufficency . i upped the prednisone for a few days and have been fine ever since. every physician that prescribes prednisone should warn their patients about this possibilty as they decrease their dose and they should instruct them to increase the dosage whenever the patient is having any type of surgery thanks so much for your post.

"I posted a few months ago to say my new GP said I must come off pred as 6 years too long.
I thought OK time to try again, have come off twice before and flared up.
I was only on 4 mgs and felt fine. re reading your or EILEEN'S post above I know I should have not allowed the pain to get so bad but I told myself it was withdrawal symptoms. so I'm now off (5 days) and feel ghastly, bilateral pain down arms, groin, across neck and feel really down. My private Rheumatologist just confirmed definitely PMR still but will tell GP to do all tests as I refused to have them done privately as GP made me withdraw the pred.
I must survive on ibuprofen and paracetamol until blood tests although I think I will have to put myself back on pred.
GP has greatly wronged me and not understood PMR in my opinion. one question! I have a very itchy back of neck with lumps, worse in the morning. Has anyone else suffered this when withdrawing from pred?

"I had eight years on steroids altogether with all th usual ups and downs of reductions and some of the side effects but I was fortunate in my GP who listened to and advised me but let me judge what I needed to keep comfortable. I have now been clear for six years and, apart from being six years older, don't seem to have much to complain about.
If you are comfortable on 4 it's hard to understand why your GP was in such a hurry to get you off altogether. Many of us have found that the final stretch has to be timed and monitored especially carefully.
Is there another GP in your Practice that you could ask to see? Also, I don't think I'd be too shy about letting your doctor know that you take a personal interest in your health and have read advice and opinions contrary to what you have been told to do. I'm sure cut and dried regimes and schedules would save a lot of GPs' time but they are not always appropriate as you are finding.
Itchy red lumps sound like an allergic reaction.... but to what?

Just when she thinks she is getting better after 2 years by reducing to 7mg, her ESR and CRP goes off the charts and she has to go back to 13mg-14mg. I hope she will try this method as her side effects (anger, depression, forgetting, etc.) are getting worse. Our fear is that these side effects will become permanent.

She doesn't need to trade the Pred side effects for another set of side effects using a drug that doesn't get you off of Pred. ------------ Any suggestions on how to deal with her depression, anger and forgetfulness? She does not want to use anti-depressant drugs but she's also fearful of the Pred side effects permanently affecting her brain. Thank you.
