"OUCH... that's a painful injury. I tore all the ligaments in my ankle. I was in a cast for months. Ligaments and tendons take longer to heal than bone. Stay off UR foot & eat right and take vitamins and supplements my doc said it helps the healing process.
Ham string is just as painful. I would ask for a support for the leg to help it heal. Every step is misery. Steroid shots never helped me. Once the numbing meds included with the injection wore off all the pain came back.
Finally a cast was the answer for my injury. I went to two docs for their opinions.
It might be a good idea for u to check it out with a sports injury orthaepedic dr. They specialize in these types of injuries u described.
Take care and hope UR on the healing trail soon.

"Hi Judy
That is exciting news, hopefully pain will decrease as you repair. Take it easy and accept all help offered. Loved ones will help I know my husband is as frustrated as I am sometimes. My husband now has private health care because of new job so I am seeking second opinion and have asked to hopefully see specialist that has seen injury before should hear this week where I need to go. In UK once you go private things happen quickly. New meds Lyrica now up to a dose which helps a bit with pain and I am using tens after day at work in evening. I am feeling a bit more positive and I hope you keep improving , let me know how you are getting on but rest when your body tells you to.

I am just a couple of weeks ahead of you I think. I work the leg brace for four weeks then the past two and half have been using walker. I am having problems that my leg wants to go off to the right. Physical therapist says one of my muscles is shortened due to not using it. My knee is also clicking and locking up. Pain in sitting area still constant. How are you doing.

"Hi Judy! I am doing ok. Some days are better than others. That sucks about your leg. When did you start physical therapy? My doctor doesn't want PT till 12 weeks. He said he would give me some exercises to do at home around 6 weeks but just the walking or shuffling is all he wants me to do. I have developed some scar tissue at the incision so I have to massage the area lightly to try and help break it up. Where are you located? I am in Ohio I hope each day gets better for you.

"JUDY!! Please help me!! I live in the Us and I had a slip and fall accident 2 months ago. I too have a Colette tear of 3 muscles and tendons 4cm away from bone. I have no pain just lots of weakness and tightness on back of my leg when bending down. Doctors have me so confused. I've already seen 3 opinions, 2 say I should have surgery but are not giving any kind of warranties plus they say it will be a very long recovery and painful. The other docitor says that at my age of 42 as healthy and active as I am I should not have such a painful risky surgery and invest my time in learning how to keep the muscle healthy and strong to avoid any other issue. But after reading so much material it only gets more confusing. Basically my ordeal is "" have the surgery or not"" considering it's already been 2 months since injury and scar tissue has already started to build up. Like u mention I move around just fine with no meds no pain but only severe tightness on back of legs "" both now"" and sore knees ... Other than that I move around actively without restrictions. The only thing I'm not doing is running or any kind of exercise only therapy to 3 times a week to strengthen the muscle. Can anyone please help me by giving me some kind of suggestion. After having a spine fusion 8 years ago and one that I'm not even aware of as it was successful but I did go through much pain during the recovery months. I really don't want to risk going back to where I once was.
Please help! Thank you

"Celia,
Did you decide to have surgery? I had surgery July 2015 for complete avulsion of hamstrings after a slip fall. The recovery has not been a joyful experience and is ongoing...over a year later. I do not regret having the surgery as the pain was unbearable. However, for me, there seems to be some type of nerve damage that caused numbness, pain, weakness, etc. I do not believe this is due to the surgery itself as I've experienced many of these issues since date of injury. My advice to you if having the surgery is to be adamant that your physician address your every ache, pain, and concern. We assumed all of my issues were due to the avulsion and did not look further into other possible injuries. As for the repair, my leg is not as strong as it once was, my gait is different, and I do not balance very well but I can walk and am thankful for that. Whatever you decide, I pray you recover well.

"Hi! I need some advise. I am 35 yrs old and have a complete hamstring rupture at the hip with 4cm retraction. I also have a complete groin libral rupture at the pelvis and hematoma >11 cm (Did the splits on ice 2-18-18). I have two doctors telling me I need repair surgergically. Then seen the orthopedic surgeon who said no surgery, just do therapy because in the long run, result is the same. If I was a NBA or NFL player he would go on and do the surgery. I seen here many ended up doing surgery even years later due to pain and issues. I already have sciatica issues from back strains when I was younger. What does everyone recommend? I'm a mom of 3 kids, a wife, full time employee at a factory, and we do lots of camping and hiking. I want as much function as possible and least amount of pain. Help?!

"Appreciated your advice. My husband had 3 tendons avulsed. Surgery was 17th day after injury. He was happy with the elevated toilet seat. We also got a trapeze bar for the bed to make it easier to sit up and transfer to crutches. 6 weeks before he can put any weight on his foot. He's clumsy with crutches but, at day 5, already feels more comfortable with sitting.

"Hi, I'm 11 months post op and still use a toilet frame, to ease down slowly, although I have dispenced with the very padded toilet seat, I had the sciatic nerve debrided as well as the re-attachement of the 3 tendons, 23 month after my accident, sitting has not improved much and I really do need my memory foam cushion. Another welcome tool would be a grabber as bending down was impossible, and a bath board as I wore a brace for 8 weeks and couldn't remove it even for showering, not that I could hop into the shower. Very trying times, I wish you both well.

"Lynda,
?I am 5 weeks post op! My hamstring was avulsed for 4 months, retracted 5cm before being reattached.
?Have great support system at home, but this recovery is a doozy! Had hip repair work done on same side last year and that was a breeze by comparison. My hamstring avulsed by chasing a ball. My hamstring had taken so much strain from my undiagnosed hip issue that had a grade 1 tear previously and I had proximal hamstring tendonopathy setting me up for the extent of my injury. My surgeon warned me that full recovery can take 2 years for some people.
?I am in brace, but can take off to shower and potty. I am also on crutches and will be til week 8 or 9 probably.
How are you doing now?

"Hi, good to hear from you, I'm now 19 months post op and three and a bits years since injury. Still suffering with pain, so much so that I'm due to have surgery on my sciatic nerve this coming Monday (if not cancelled at last minute, a hazard using NHS in UK) it is a slow recovery for some of us as we are all different and no two injuries as identical. Try to stay positive and do not rush and overdo things.
Wishing you all the best and Happy Holidays

"Lynda,
Wishing you success with this upcoming surgery! Apparently that release technique is necessary for many. ( It is a shame they did not do it when they reattached.)
Please when you are up for it after surgery keep me posted on your progress.
I am expecting a 2 yr recovery for myself as my right side has had a lot of trama.
I hit week 6 post op today and over the last 2 days have seen some good progress tolerating being up longer w a bit less aggrevation.
I see Dr this Mon and am suppose to return to work ( hairstylist) light shifts starting Tues...
Can't imagine being able to drive my car since I have not sat in that position for 6 weeks!
I am rooting for you!!!

"Hi Michelle, many thanks, I was so so lucky that I was referred back to the nerve specialist and that he agreed to operate, its VERY rare, for all those months I was told that I was a slow healer and things may or may not improve. If they hadn't done an ultrasound (MRI was out of the question due to cost) to see if the reattachement was okay and noticed the nerve was covered in scar tissue, I would still be suffering. Driving the car (manual gear change) has been extremely painful, luckily I only work (sitting down 99% of the time) 6 hours, two days a week, take things steady when you go back. I will keep you posted. Take care

"Hi, had surgery, far more invasive than I thought, nerve well and truly stuck, they managed to free up all they could but couldn't investigate by the repair to the hamstring without causing more damage. Very very sore and I feel so vulnerable without the previous protection of the brace. Surgeon said to be realistic and not to expect miracles, but I am confident that at this early stage, there has been some improvement. Take care Lx

"Lynda,
​So glad you got your surgery!!! I am happy to hear that while it was so invasive you feel there will be some measure of relief!
​I understand about the brace! I hope you will have ample recovery time.
​I went back to work a few hours each day this week. I am allowed to drive, but have not felt ready so been bumming rides to and from work. I could NOT do more than 3-4 hrs (hairstylist) without much aggravation. Overall , I think I am doing ok though all things considered!
​Rest, recovery and be good to yourself! You have suffered so long! No rushing !

"Happy New Year, I'm still very sore due to the incision, approx 8 inches long and they must have gone 1 to 2 inches deep, but I'm pretty sure that it feels better, I'm up to about a mile walk a day, which is handy as I have to go to London tomorrow for a wound check and I'd rather not get a cab from the station.

My problem was that I was misdiagnosed and had to wait nearly two years before surgery. Take things slowly and don't rush into trying to do too much too soon. Wishing you all the very best

"Hi! I need some advise. I am 35 yrs old and have a complete hamstring rupture at the hip with 4cm retraction. I also have a complete groin libral rupture at the pelvis and hematoma >11 cm (Did the splits on ice 2-18-18). I have two doctors telling me I need repair surgergically. Then seen the orthopedic surgeon who said no surgery, just do therapy because in the long run, result is the same. If I was a NBA or NFL player he would go on and do the surgery. I seen here many ended up doing surgery even years later due to pain and issues. I already have sciatica issues from back strains when I was younger. What does everyone recommend? I'm a mom of 3 kids, a wife, full time employee at a factory, and we do lots of camping and hiking. I want as much function as possible and least amount of pain. Help?!

"Hi there. I slipped and fell in my bathtub Dec 9, 2014 and had an avulsion of hamstring plus tendons. I too was not operated on since I was 58 yrs old and not an athlete. It's been a long year. The pain is constant from my butt down to the middle of my thigh. The gap from the bone to where the hamstring ended up is 10 cm. Went for a second opinion - this dr said surgery is the only way I would get relief. We've tried cortizone shots, PT, gabbepentin. No luck. Oh well. Surgery now set for Dec. I have no idea what to expect as far as post surgery. Does anyone have any suggestions for someone who lives alone during the post operative phase? Oh, and the dr says no brace and back to work in 4 weeks (I sit at a computer all day 10-12 hrs).

"I had surgery Oct 14, 2015 for a complete hamstring rupture. I had been dealing with partial tears for about 2 years, had steroid injections But nothing would help that pain I was having in my sitz bone. I continued to work thru the pain and tried to stay active but playing sand volleyball I felt the burn which I knew was the end. I am 4 weeks post op and it hasn't been easy. The 1st 2 weeks I basically did nothing but lay around and let it heal. I didn't want to do anything to mess it up. My doctor didn't put me in a brace either the only thing he wanted me to do was shuffle when I walked. So I have the Tim Conway shuffle down now!! Each week I get stronger but still can't do too much without getting sore. I am going to try and go back to work this week for 4 hours a day for 4 weeks. I sit all day so that is the challenge. Sitting is still hard. They told me at my last appointment it would be up to a year to heal. I also will not do any type of physical therapy until I am 12 weeks post op. Good luck to you and remember shuffle!!

"Cathy, thanks so much for the info. Surgery is set for next Thursday. They're not sure what to do with me since I live alone and need to climb 29 stairs to my apt. They may send me to a rehab hospital. I just wonder how I'm going to do all the normal things we do without help since I'll be on crutches for at least 4 weeks. My son will be here for a couple of days, but he works full time and going for his Master's, so he's very busy. The dr has me out of work for 6 weeks. Sitting is my biggest complaint right now as well as my leg wanting to go in whatever direction except straight. Frustrating to shop when I'm not sure I'll be able to make it down an aisle. Thank goodness for home delivery and on line shopping. PT I'm not sure about.

"This may be scary to some, but my surgeon has never done surgery like this --- he's done the acute type, but not the chronic so it should be very interesting. I'm told he's excellent, so I'm not too concerned. He also wants to try to avoid an allograft which is fine with me if the sutures will work. May I ask what type of incision you had? I noticed you mentioned scar tissue at the incision site. I've read various articles where some surgeons prefer the latitudinal incision and others do both the latitude and longitude for chronic avulsions. Guess I'll find out after surgery.

"Hi Cathy. Wow! Surgery was 2nd week in Dec. one lesson learned, don't have surgery so close to the holidays. A couple of surprises. Apparently there was so much blood in the torn area that it obscured the tendon connected to the ischial tuberosity. So instead of complete rupture it was actually only a partial. Surprise #2 - the sciatic nerve was so totally encapsulated in scar tissue that the scar tissue actually pulled the nerve against the bone so I was literally sitting on the sciatic nerve. Have a 15 cm incision from my butt down. Have been in a brace (that was a surprise to me) and on crutches. Was in hospital 3 days and rehab hospital 4 days to learn to go up and down stairs. A little scare when the incision opened up in a small area and being on blood thinners blood everywhere - happened twice. There is still a lot of pain while sitting and having to go back to work in 3 weeks makes me nervous, PT at home, but basically to just get me moving and not putting weight on my leg and again with the stairs. My apartment needs a good cleaning, so I'm frustrated about that. Get to see the surgeon on Monday for first time since hospital, Oh and by the way the elevated cutout toilet seat a definite life saver. Best thing ever. I may be starting hydro therapy soon, not sure.

"Lori that sounds bad! I guess I am lucky mine was not as complicated. I remember feeling like I would never be able to do anything but doing nothing and letting it heal was the best thing to do. It will be so worth it. I started PT just this week and had 1 session and was really hesitant to let them do anything but I was told to take it slow. Just afraid I will tear it again!! I can't believe how much muscle loss I have had and the muscles around my butt are really sore. Dr said it is a long recovery and I think he is right!! Hang in there and keep in touch.

"Hi Adriana. You sound similar to my situation. I am so glad I did it ! I was in pain for so many years with just minor tears so once it snapped I knew it needed to be done. Before I did it ever step I took walking upstairs hurt. Couldn't do squats etc. I too had one dr that said I wouldn't have to do it and just live with it but I felt like I was old (53) but enjoyed being active and felt Still had some years left to play sports. I think you will be happy with it. How many of these procedures has the dr done? Mine was only 60 to 70 but he was the best from Ohio State University so I was in good hands. It is a slow recovery but I know this so I will be patient. Good Luck!! Yes they like to do it as soon as possible after the injury because it must be easier to reattach. Keep me posted!! Shuffle shuffle shuffle is all you can do after for about 6 weeks but hang in there it will be worth it!!

"Hi Cathy. Don't know if you're still blogging, but I'll give it a try. Dr extended my sick leave until March. Got my brace off last week (8 weeks post op). Started pool therapy - first week was horrible - the pain and cramping AFTER. I'm still having a lot of pain sitting (no more than 15 minutes on semi-soft chairs; no more than 5 minutes on hard chairs). Not only does my sitz bone hurt, but if feels like there's a log going down my thigh when I sit. I have to go back to work in 3 weeks and this makes me very nervous. PT says up/down desk is essential for me to be released. Dr has increased some meds, but I can't take the percocet. Also like you the muscle weakness is crazy. My leg just doesn't want to hold up so PT is working on strengthening and getting me off the crutches. I can walk some, but then I need to grab onto something so I don't hit the floor.
Just wondering how you are doing and if this sounds normal. I'm so frustrated and tired of hurting.

"Hi Cathy. My surgery was in the middle of December. I am in my 6th week of rehab (2 days pool therapy 1 day land per week). The leg is still really weak, so much so that when I stepped back on it last week, I ended up on my back looking at the ceiling. I wasn't hurt, but it was quite a surprise. My dr wasn't happy and extended my work leave another month. I haven't asked about the deep tissue massage yet. I'm still having way too much pain in the area especially to the touch. It's getting better, but the doc said when it comes to nerves, it's going to take a long time, especially with all the work he did releasing the sciatic nerve from all the scar tissue. I am now using a cane and the dr doesn't even want me walking around the house without it. At least the pain is lessening to some extent. At least I can sit on the couch for longer than 5 minutes. Hard chairs are still out of the question and I'm sitting on two pillows in the computer chair here at home. Driving is still challenging due to the pressure on my thigh. They have begun to increase the intensity level in PT which is good. Hurts after, but I need to get this leg to start working again.
Hope you are continuing to do well.

"Crystal,
I can't say for sure, but my experience is medical universities with orthopedic teaching hospitals have surgeons which can address hamstring avulsions.
Also, if you are near any major sports teams and can find knee/hip doctors who support a sports team , they will likely be able to do the surgery.
Another idea: call an MRI radiology facility and ask the office manager to ask around with their musculoskeletal radiologists : ""which hip/knee doctors within an hour of here are experienced with reattaching torn hamstring tendons?""
Go in on a Monday (or send spouse) with a box of donuts and little cards with your phone and email written out . Someone likely will tell you who to check with.
Expect to be told ""unless you are an athlete, you really don't need surgery unless .......""
I would guess that Louisville or Lexington would have surgeons who repair these.
Please keep us all posted on your search.

"Thank you Walter. I went to the Lexington office. That is where I got the ""since your not an athlete you don't need to have it fixed, just do therapy"". He wanted me to do 6 weeks of therapy and claims if that don't fix it, I would be the first ever to require surgery. My PT friends tell me they can help, but can't fix a tendon retracted 4cm and completely torn. I have had two other orthopedics that told me I do need repaired but their groups have never done it before. I think the next place to try Louisville. This is an extremely rare injury and surgery in this area. I just don't want life long limitations if I don't have to.

"Crystal,
I totally understand. I heard the same thing many times.
Consider the other ideas I mentioned. Reach out to radiologists since they would certainly know which docs can fix it, because those are the docs that more frequently order the MRI studies. L
If you can't find surgeons near you, it is not that terribly far between KY and Durham NC. Duke university orthopedics has hip doctors who have fixed these before. I don't have any experience with these docs yet.
Also, Look for sports medicine ortho docs vs joint replacement ortho docs.

Sorry I've come on to this thread so late....I used to be aalways on these forums but have been having a break recently,
I dont know about your injury but I have and avulsion of ther greater trochanter bone.
This happened weeks post op after 2nd Total hip replacement, doing an NHS exercise and there was a massive crack That was almost 2 years ago and I'm still on crutches and still trying to get on top of the pain. No one has ever heard of this before infact very few beople know what an avulsion is
I'm in the UK Told it will not heal, no operation for it. If they could get on top of the pain it would be a help.
Steroid injections were no good whatso ever......they are now trying a low dose of morphine {not happy.....a bit scared of it}
By the way the trochanter is at the top of the leg.....at the femur roughly.
I had never heard of it before

"Hi Sherri! I had a complete hamstring rupture repair in October. I had minor tears for about 2 years and kept getting injections and tried working thru it but playing sand volleyball I felt a horrible burn and knew something More had happened. I had the MRI and it was a complete rupture. I got in to see a great orthopedic surgeon at the ohio state university Dr Christopher Kaeding and he got me in the following week to do the repair. They want to do it as soon as possible after the tear because it is easier to repair. My recovery consisted of 12 weeks of shuffling and 4 weeks of doing basically nothing. I am 54 and so glad I did the surgery. I was in so much pain and I know it's a long recovery but it will be worth it. Keep me posted on what you decide to do.

"Hi Sherri, Can you be a bit more precise about your hamstring injury. The hamstrings are three separate muscles which attach via tendons at the ischial tuberosity at the top. Hamstring injuries at the sit bone can range from a small tear in just one of the tendons to complete avulsions of one, two or all three tendons. I have two of the three tendons completely avulsed with 4 cm retraction. I have done much research on this and it would seem that the decision to operate is largely governed by how many tendons are detached and how far they have retracted. How many tendons are injured, if completely detached, how far have they retracted?

"Hi
The mri report shows rupture of the hamstring tendons from their origin on the ischial tuberosity and associated near complete rupture of the muscles of the semimembranosus and semitendinous.

"Hi, it's been a year almost to the day since surgery, the most significant change is I no longer have the sciatica which was unbearable, I still have trouble walking and need a memory foam cushion as sitting is still very painful. I do not regret the surgery but wish I had some idea before hand how life changing it would be, I should have researched all the items I needed to make things easier,like bath board, frame for the wc, purchasing stool, grabber, I can only manage to work two days a week due to the sitting, but that suits me, driving is an issue due to manual car but for journeys up to half an hour are bareable. I have a follow-up at the hospital this month and I am sure things are slow but going well. My issues are probably down to the two year delay in getting the surgery, it's a good thing that I am reasonably fit for my age,62, and try to keep myself as fit as possible. I hope all goes well but remember it can be a long painful journey back.Take care

"It sounds as though only one of the tendons has come away from the ischial tuberosity. As far as the other two are concerend if the damage is in the muscle, this is usual at the muscular tendon junction and is not treated surgically. This heals by itself. If the tendon that is detached is not retracted too far then it will scar down to neighbouring structures and you will still have suficient tension on that muscle for it to be pretty functional. So given time you will end up with two good hamstrings and one not quite perfect. Even if the detached hamstring is retracted further it is rare to operate as function will still be pretty good, maybe for a professional athlete they would. Roughly speaking, the point where they would consider operating is with two or more tendons detached and more than 2cm retraction. Hope that helps.

"In February of 2014, I suffered a proximal hamstring avulsion/rupture after falling from a deck. The prognosis was two complete tendon ruptures/retractments with the third tendon damaged but not completely ruptured/retracted. I also had extensive tearing in the belly of the hamstring muscle. The decision-making process for surgery or non-operative rehabilitation was a very difficult decision for me, as I read many blogs and saw many specialists with conflicting opinions. Furthermore, given the rarity of the injury, most of the surgeons I saw had either never performed the surgery, or performed very few times. As such, they were not able to confidently give the pros/cons of surgery vs. non-operative procedure with high conviction. Ultimately, I finally found a surgeon who had performed many procedures over the years, as well as some on top athletes. Given that I was an extremely active 26 year old that wanted to return to high-performance athletic activities (running, biking, climbing, skiing, swimming etc.) I decided that surgery was my best option. Two years later, I am very glad a made that decision. The recovery was difficult initially, but I improved rapidly over the first 6 months. While I currently still have some limitations/irritations, I feel the outcome was much better than what would have been achieved going the non-operative route. Unfortunately I still do have poor flexibility in the leg, and relative weakness compared to the other. Also, sitting for long periods of time also causes discomfort, and it gets tired earlier than my other leg, as well as soreness after heavy usage. However, I have been able to return to all of my previous athletic endeavors, with almost no actual limitations. I would classify the leg as about 85% of original form, and I feel I should be able to get it to 90% - 95% over time. So I would highly recommend the surgery for all those who wish to live an active lifestyle post-injury.

Surgery and rehab were extremely successful. I was able to train and run the NYC marathon in November 2014, almost exactly one year after I started walking again post surgery. I continue to run, play sports, and weight train. I get pain sometimes but am not limited at all. I hope this helps!

"Hi: I am going to have surgery next Wednesday. I am 69, very active, love to hike, walk, go to the gym, exercise. I have a complete avulsion of all 3 hamdstring muscles, they are about 4 cm down. I fell heavily while mopping the floor about 2 1/2 weeks ago, slipped on the wet floor - and was in pretty bad pain for about 10 days!
I was told that unless I accept not being able to have same activity level to have this surgery. Kind of apprehensive about it, since it seems it is a long and painful recovery, so totally not looking forward to that, especially since right now my pain level is actually tolerable, and I can walk slowly etc. - but don't want to be a couch potato for the next 20 years.
If someone could help me with the following: I read and was told that it is real painful to sit on a chair/couch etc. afterwards, and I know from when my injury was brandnew, that I could not sit on the toilet, or on a chair without excrutiating pain.
Anyone creative suggestions? Read about a raised, cut out toilet seat - how does that work?
Any suggestions from anyone in regards to make the recovery easier? Not sure of my rehab programm yet, will discuss with my Ortho Surgeon tomorrow. I am in California, in Santa Barbara, and there is only one Surgeon in town who does these surgeries, and even at that he does not do more than 6 or 8 per year - pretty scary!! But the option to go to LA, and have to drive for 2 hours, be in a Hotel etc. is not enticing at all - so, I am trusting he performed enough surgeries to know what he is doing, which I hope is correct.
Thanks for support!

"I feel for you. I had a complete avulsion repair at the end of March and I can tell you that it will get easier to do the things that you normally do. I say that because it has only been in the last few weeks that I've been able to sit on a toilet without leaning from the affected side. For the first 6 weeks, I used alot of ice packs. I'm still not able to put on my left sock and shoe, but I am seeing progress in being able to reach my foot. I understand that this type of injury is one that can take a long time to heal and I will probably be limited in some of the things that I do. I'm 51 and from the first consult with my surgeon, it was a given that I would need surgical intervention. But I was surprised when he told me that I would not need therapy. I still have constant pain and am rarely comfortable unless I lay on my stomach. I want to begin building my muscles in that leg but I am so wary. I can't afford to miss any more work and was forced to go back earlier that I should have. I wish you the best and want you to remember that it will get easier, I promise.

"For me, I had a raised toilet seat at home that helped a great deal! it sort of sits on top of you toilet seat and is raised so that you are not having to bend so far over - plus, with bandages and your incision, it can get tough to use a bathroom initially (at least it was for me, as a female!) It's dealing with public bathrooms that was difficult! I never appreciated handicap accessibility so much! I was in a leg brace and crutches for almost 8 weeks with no weight bearing so I spent a lot of time sitting and in a recliner when home. I was not allowed to remove the brace at all - i put a chair in the shower and got a removable shower head to help and showered the best i could! the mobile shower head helped a lot! Be sure to keep moving though! Getting up and moving around helps reduce post surgery complications!

"I'm actually alot happier than I was just a month ago. And eventhough sitting on the toilet is still very uncomfortable, I do feel improvments in my overall condition. It's more frustrating than anything else.
In just the last few weeks, I've noticed big strides in my recovery. I'm not taking anymore pain meds, although there are times when I've wished that I still had them.
My surgeon told me that he didn't believe that I would need therapy and to me, that sounded odd. So I've taken it upon myself to do some therapy on my own. I have a friend who is going to get me some therapy bands and then I'll try my eliptical machine.
I want you to feel encouraged, knowing that even though this is a process that requires patience, you will be fine. I'm still working on my patience.

She also suggested I get some memory foam pillows for sitting on. I did get the memory foam but it's still rather uncomfortable top sit. I had surgery one week ago today. I hope your surgery went well!

"Hello! I am very grateful for this forum! I am a physician, mom, and runner who avulsed the conjoint hamstring tendon from the ischial tuberosity in late April while sprinting; I was finally diagnosed and then opereated on 2 weeks ago, at 4.5 weeks post-injury. To be clear, the ONE tendon, called the conjoint (or ""common"" hamstring tendon, attaches TWO of the hamstring muscles to the hip bone...the biceps femoris and the semimembranous muscles. My tendon, connecting these 2 muscles, was 3 cm retracted, along with an 18 cm hematoma. My recovery, largely in bed, has been great so far. I was off all pain meds, including Tylenol, at the one week mark. Still uncomfortable to sit, so I avoid that. Surgeon did NOT brace me, but of course I am to avoid hip flexion with knee extension. I get up a bit to walk around the house and backyard deck, to take care of hygeine, then back to bed. I see a NURSE tomorrow, as the surgeon doesn't see me until 6 weeks post-surgery. I am planning to return to work at 4 weeks post-op, but am concerned I will not be able to sit by then. Most of my job involves sitting. Does anyone have any experience with this? And, I start PT at 4 weeks...how often did you all go for PT? Any advice will be welcome!!!

"Hello! You are about a week and a half ahead of me. I had surgery a week ago today for the same injury. I'm not wearing a brace either and have been directed to walk using only small steps, then at 6 weeks, I'll be able to walk with a normal stride and then at 12 weeks I begin PT. I'm off pain meds and have been laying around too. I had hoped to be able to return to work soon but reading all the posts, it doesn't sound realistic. Good luck in your recovery. Ill be watching the posts so please check-in if you learn anything interesting.

"Hi! Thanks to all who posted re the avulsion. Are you walking with small steps without crutches? I am walking now with 50% weight bearing with crutches, and just a slightly smaller stride than usual. However, at 2.5 weeks out I am able to sit comfortably with just a standard chair cushion. This makes me very hopeful that I can return to work in 1.5 weeks. I will need someone to help me with carrying charts and things as I cannot carry anything of substance with crutches, but most of my job involves sitting. Let's keep each other posted!!!

"Hi Teri, I am not using crutches. The surgeon said I would feel like I needed them right after the surgery but that I would probably find them more of a bother after a couple of days - which is exactly what occurred. My injury, from water skiing, may not have been as bad as yours. I had more than an 80 percent tear from the ischial tuberosity with a 4 cm retraction. My restrictions are small strides and no bending at the waist with legs straight. Sitting is definitely an issue. Upon suggestion of my surgeon, I bought some memory foam to sit on, which helps a little but is certainly not comfortable! A concern since my job is primarily sitting.
I have my first post-op on the 16th so I look forward to learning more details of the surgery and recovery. I'm not allowed to drive at this time. I look forward to reading about your progress!

"Hi! Have faith re sitting. The difference for me between 1.5 weeks and 2.5 weeks with sitting was incredible. There was no way I could sit at 1.5 weeks, but now sitting comfortably. The incision healed quite a bit during that time as well. I am now just using a pillow or chair cushion and it is fine, even for hours at a time. You sound like you are doing really well, I am sure you will be fine!! Best, Teri

"So happy I finally found something about what has happened!! I'm a firefighter/ paramedic who has been training for an Ironman. I was running when I fell 8 days ago and completely tore all 3 of my hamstring muscles off. I am very physically active. Run, cycle and swim daily! I am devastated by this! I am scheduled for surgery July 6. I'm in crutches but have a hard to getting around due to the pain and still van not straighten my leg. Does this sound familiar? I am unable to ait on my right side due to the avulsion. This is all a nightmare. Any idea how long I will be out of work?

"Hi Teri, I hope you are doing well and that your surgery and PT has been successful.
I salute all the brave women and men that have taken the time to share their stories and build a community while helping other sufferers of tendon tears and avulsions.
My story is almost identical to yours. I was standing on an old unmaintained tennis court and stepped one foot forward to toss a frisbee to my dog , and the foot kept sliding and I fell down into a ""perfect split.""
I am 58, very active with bike riding , volunteer work, water sports ( windsurfing and wakeboarding and occasional water skiing .
Nearly identical 3.3cm avulsion of common tendon off the ischial tuberosity . All muscles sprained, and semimembranosis tendon also stressed.
Edema of 16 x 6 x 5 cm contacting sciatic nerve - you all know it hurts.
Thanks to everyones' comments I immediately asked for MRI and got it quickly.
I am less than 2 weeks post injury.
I am considering surgery and weighing + / - of getting surgery vs letting it heal, and living with the issues that may likely cause.
Here's the Questions.
Asking the folks who did not do surgery :
What issues are worst for you now , and how was your recovery?
How long did it take for the awful sit-bone pain and hematoma throbbing to diminish ?
What are your top ten tips to get through this ordeal ?
Asking those who got the repair surgery:
What are the preparations my wife and I need to make to make the recovery manageable?
When could you go up / down one flight of stairs?
When did t
Before the surgery, Should I get someone to install an overhead bar, or large rings to grab while getting up and down from bed?
How hard is it to be immobilized with both a hip flexion brace and a knee flexion brace for 6-8 weeks?
How tough is it to rebuild muscles after the immobilization atrophy?
What tips for using the potty (#2)? Overhead grab bar? Elevated booster seat?
How close are your incusion(s) to the BM zone and what tips have you learned?
Does it make sense to Buy an add-on fanny sprayer for the toilet, and get it installed pre-surgery? (The sprayer we use is controllable And keeps the water centered over the mid-line.
I have No clue how close the incision dressings are to the BM zone.
When were your surgery dressings removed ?
How do you sleep with braces on?
Did anyone have 2 braces ?
Was your surgeon able to relieve the hematoma as a normal course of the surgery?
How was your wound care and maintenance ?
What type of incision did you have ?
What are best dressings for wound care?
What lessons were learned with PT?
I bet it us easy to gain weight. What are people's tips on weight gain avoidance (portion limits and no sweets?)
I hope that our kind community can contribute to my upfront learning, and that together we can build a great list of
must-haves and suggestions for everyone.
We all feel bad about our injuries , but our ability to support one another and share lessons- learned is truly a god send.
Many thanks , blessings, and best wishes to all.

Had reattachment at 4 !/2 months. My detachment occur running after a ball. My hamstring was very degraded from previous injury and a lot of strain from and undiagnosed hip issue ( had that repaired 6/2016)

​As for rehabilitation I have been told over and over again it is a slow process. My hamstring was unused 6 full months. Tendon is slow at healing. The forward moment is there though an just about as I reach my boiling point with frustration I turn another corner.

"Hi Michelle,
How wonderfully kind and supportive for you to share so much information! I sincerely thank you.
Your recovery sounds daunting.
I wish you the best and Want you to know you will have another person in your corner pulling for you.
The information you have provided is great. I have a similar house configuration, but fortunately have a small guestroom in the downstairs bathroom and agree with you about the stairs.
Relaxation ""meditations"" help with attitude and getting centered:
My wife turned me on to listening to YouTube relaxation meditations. By listening to these before I go to bed and whenever I feel a little down I am able to reset myself to a good place.
There are many different topics from relaxation, to stress relief, to positive reinforcement healing..... and the Aussie accents are nice to hear.
It is so easy to go to sleep by, and our brains still take in as we sleep.
I wonder if other folks on the group have similar methods.
PT and kinesiotape :
One of my daughters is the physical therapist, but she lives 150 miles away.
It is amazing that many doctors do not appreciate how doctors of physical therapy (DPT) today have vast anatomy and body mechanic training far beyond that of orthopedists.
The tricky part is finding a good physical therapist.
My daughter told us that we could relieve pain and perhaps speed the hematoma resolution by finding a DPT Who is experiencing in the usage of elasticized
Kinesiotape.
I did some experimentation that may be useful to others after my DPT daughter explained the goals and overall method of using this technique.
I experimented by gently pulling on all different areas of my thigh and hamstring , from the crotch all the way down to the knee .
Anywhere that I felt some pain relief, I marked it on a crude diagram outlining the specific area, and in which direction I was pulling.
My daughter said you can also use a pen directly on your skin and indicate the direction that you're pulling once you find an area that provide some pain relief.
I found a good PT locally, and Asked them to please tape me up with kinesiotape after they did a full Eval.
I shared the diagram, and she applied Kinesio tape which she pre-tensioned at various force levels along areas I had identified.
I asked her to explain the anatomy of the tendons and muscles and asked her if there may be other areas she could try to use the tape to stabilize the structure.
She taught my wife and I a lot, and let us videotape her as she explained the tensioning of the tape, cutting of it and the geographic landmarks that she was applying it at.
So far, I have gotten really good pain relief and a much more stable feeling after the work that PT did with the tape.
Best of all, you can buy the tape yourself from Amazon and you can find YouTube clips about the usage of this kinesio tape .
So far I have seen four doctors, and none of them thought it would be significant.
I guess we all use the tools of our trade which is why the docs do not think much of it.
It is relatively inexpensive and it is very unlikely someone can hurt themselves by using it.
Have other people on our group found this to be useful?
I love that we have tools that we do not need the docs for, so that our mental outlook is not tied to someone else..... we are not helpless.
Then again, I am just beginning this unplanned journey .
Thanks again for the kindness you have shown to this Newbie!

My 1st surgery was to repair my hip. I did not understand at the time how truly damaged my hamstring was. a year into the hip recovery I detached my hamstring. So my situation was not from an accident. I had the previous tear, pht and later in my hip recovery I was having a lot of pain in hammie when exercise walking. Dr later explained my hammie had been slowly tearing more and more.

"Hi Celia.
Sept 26th I slipped while in Mexico. Needless to say I tore a 9cm hole in the middle hamstring.
I returned home the following day and a day later I went to a walk in clinic. Had an ultrsound and xrays. Initially I was told a complete tear and a consultation with an orthopaedic surgeon said no surgery.
I was in so much pain they booked me with a sports medicine Dr who did another ultrasound and it was discovered that was was not a complete tear...but worse. There was no option for surgery. The ultrasound also showed a giant hole 9cm and my body had absorbed all the original blood that should have acted like a scab. Something to mend the hole.
I was offered PRP (platelet rich plasma) treatments. They draw a fair amount of blood. Separate the platelets by spinning it in a special machine and under tge guidance of the ultrasound, inject it back into the hamstring. It's not cheap. And it's not covered by OHIP in Ontario. $600 per injection. After having 2 we did another ultrasound 4 weeks in and found it had healed from 9 to 2.6cm. So I opted for a third injection. I have also been seeing on of the best physio therapists around. He used to be head physio therapist for the Toronto Maple Leafs and later the Coyotes. Both my Dr and Chris know the injuries well. I was told mine was on of the worst they've seen.
So greats Dr. And proper physio were key.
I never missed a day of work.
Last week I was given the clear to return to the gym.
I was told that 2.6 may never heal without the PRP
My advicell...find a sports medicine Dr and speak about PRP. I am wiling to spend anything for quality of life
Good Luck

"Hi Sandra
I know it's a while. But how are you? As I too have the same horrible injury I slipped on water in my bathroom, did the splits! Aug 2014. Sadly NHS didn't listen. Uneducated in this injury. Unless I was told later on you are a footballer or skier etc.
After not listening to me begging for a MRI & doing what I was told by physio therapists. I got eventually got an MRI in Dec 2014. Told all 3 hamstrings detached & rolled down my leg 10cm. Leg was full of hematomas too.
Now like you hip pain. Pain where hamstrings are in pain. Balance is bad & can't sit long in same position. Leg weak.
I did personally email all the orthopedic surgeons in London. Found prof hadid. Jan 2015. Saw him & told it was too late. As atrophy sets in.
I try to focus on what I can do & not what I used to do. As was very active. Do you find bending down & lifting hard?

"Hi, sorry to hear you couldn't have the surgery, your injury mirrored mine but I was fortunate that
I was put in touch with a nerve specialist, a Mile Fox from Stanmore (lovely man) who agreed to debride the sciatic nerve
if Prof Haddad would reattach the hamstrings, luckily he agreed.
Sitting is a nightmare even with a memory foam cushion, I still get a stabbing pain in the buttock when I bend forward putting on shoes and socks,
as for walking, still odd and painful, after 25 sessions of physio, I have improved but there is still a long way to go. If I was treated appropriately at the time, things would have been different!

"Wow Lynda Prof Haddad reattached your hamstrings? Brave time for you & even though you are still having issues sure you will get there. How much had your hamstrings detached? & how long after your injury did you see Prof Haddad. I saw him 5 mths after my fall. He said the physio I had from Sept 2014 to Dec 2014 didn't help as they were treating me without an MRI/XRAY (which I asked for at my very first apt as internally my leg felt so bad) But told you have a significant hamstring injury go home and do these excercises, walk go back to work. Think it aided my hamstrings to go further down than were probably at the start to be honest. It's very sad as was only 47 when I did it & it has basically stopped my active, both in work & home, life. Think local dr's/hosp should be more aware of listening to how the patient feels. What they say.
I hope you do get relief from your discomfort sure you will as do know that nerve endings etc take ages to settle down.

"Hi, I had my injury July 2014, but it took months before I had an MRI which showed the unusual tear, 1st consultant I saw said I was too old (59) and didn't ski or play tennis so I didn't warrant an op, got a 2nd opinion Dec 2014 but after months of physio, injections, he decided to refer me to Mr Mike Fox (a friend of his) I saw him in Oct 2015 who agreed to operate, if Prof Haddad agreed. I didn't even see him at his clinic in Jan 2016, he agreed to do it without me seeing him, due to getting the two consultants available at the same time, took until June 2016, I was told it was retracted about 6inches and there was much scar tissue around the sciatic nerve, hence the large scar.I was in a right state, couldn't drive,walk, sit, sleep, had to cut work to two part time days, even now I can only manage two days. No one appreciated just how awful it was and still is. I complained about the initial diagnosis, a minor tissue injury, and got an apology from the hospital, but the damage was done, I just have to get on with it. I realise that I'll never be as fit as I was but I 'm doing my best and not give in. I'm only sorry that I didn't make more of a fuss at the time and that no one was really interested as it wasn't a typical injury and easy to fix .I dred to think what I would be like now if I didn't have the good fortune to see Mr Fox.

Pleased that you got hope re surgery etc.it was a year after you I saw him. He was appalled that local NHS didn'tt identify it. The London hosp pick up on it straight away apparently.
Your right I wish I made more of a fuss too. But at the time you trust who you speak too. Nice to get an apology. A&E I got as far as a triage nurse & sent home after 2 mins. The she went out for a cigarette. Just shows the flippancy. I wish u well and I find to deal on it on a daily basis. Not preempt this injury.

"Hi Lynda after my horrible fall in Aug 2014 my husband took me to the Conquest hosp A&E. Sadly got as far as a triage nurse. Sent home after seeing her for 2 mins. Told to see my Dr. My Dr had sadly retired. He would of taken me seriously. Next day my husband did take me and we saw a Dr in the practice which I didn't really want to see as had a bad reputation. But I was very desperate as in so much pain & inside my leg it didn't feel ok at all. She gave me very strong painkillers told to go home and rest and she'd refer me to local physio therapists. Following 2 weeks saw a physio therapist. Where I still couldn't get an MRI. Done what I was told. By Dec 2014 I was in a mess. Saw a endoscope practitioner who was very worried. Talked of DVT etc. Bowel and bladder problems. Said I needed an MRI. At last!! I was told my MRI would be Feb 2015. I had a right go!! As was beside myself by then. Got MRI Dec 2014. Got the bad news. It really frightened me. So I emailed all the orthopedic secretaries in London for some hope! I got an email recommending prof Haddad I asked my new Dr to refer me to him and she did as was & is very sympathetic. I saw him Jan/Feb 2015. Told it was too late. That's my story. Very frustrating, painful, stressful & life changing time really. As I'm sure you understand. Hope you getting there? I did have under prof Haddad & Rosie Tanseys recommendation 18 mths of physio here locally. My hamstrings have rolled down 11cm & connected themselves in my leg & I pray they don't atrophise anymore. On my right side of my knee I have partial detachment but hopefully trying to be active keeps them working to bend my knee and walk!! Bending down for things is terrible. But like you must do you improvise try to cope. Wish you well. Louise

"Hi, All. I'm new to forums, so I probably posted this incorrectly.
I hope everyone is well. In comparison to others' struggles, mine is minimal, I know.
I guess I'm hoping someone has a brilliant idea.
I have been searching for others with similar situations--hamstring complete tear or avulsion that was not surgically repaired. After reading your posts, I realize that I've experienced a similar approach in the Eastern U.S. I was a runner (jogger is more correct). Tripped and fell in March 2016. No MRI, No xray. The Dr. decided it wasn't an avulsion or complete tear based on a clinical/observational exam. She prescribed conservative PT for 8 weeks. I came to find out later, complete tear of entire hamstring muscle group in the left leg with 6.5 cm. tendon retraction and inoperable and partial tear in the right leg...I think if I were younger or a professional athlete the outcome would have been different. I would have been sent for MRI and surgery would have been possible.
I'm nearing the 2 year mark---and I'm struggling to reclaim my identity and ANY level of fitness-- I'm wondering if anyone has ideas or hints- now that I'm closing in on 2 years, I'm able just about able to walk at a typical pace for a 46 year old, though I have daily pain in both legs and I am prevented from regular and helpful exercise. There are things I cannot do and will not expect to do (pushing my father in a wheel chair, mowing the lawn, running to catch up with my 1.5 year old nephew, carrying things that need bending/lifting with the legs. Gained 40 pounds (sorry, US measurements) in less than 2 years due to inactivity.
Thanks,

"Hello, I’m hoping I can help. I got reconstructive surgery 1.5 years after my injury. My function is much better than it was prior to surgery. I cannot run for long distances, but I also was never a runner. I was in a similar situation where I was only given an X-ray, no need for an MRI even though I was in significant pain, had a large amount of bleeding, and had a huge lack of function. Finally went to Mayo Clinic with Dr Chris Larson a year after my injury. Please look into surgery if you’re willing, and also stand your ground and advocate for yourself. If you’re not where you want to be, don’t let a doctor tell you that you shouldn’t have certain interventions because they don’t seem you active enough.

"Hi Heather,
Have you considered seeing docs that are associated with dr teaching programs? I think they might be able to assess and help you decide risk/reward of surgery.
Thanks to this forum teaching me, I saw 5 docs and I also insisted on an MRI right after the accident . If I did what 3 of the docs suggested it would be ""do nothing.""
Most sports ortho docs never see the kind of complete hamstring tendon avulsions we all have had , they are not trained in repairing them , and perhaps it represents a liability risk for them to do surgery ? If that is correct, it is easier to say all the things we all have heard :
You don't need surgery .... only an athlete would get this surgery, etc etc, blah, blah.
In contrast , the docs that are part of a big teaching hospital (like Duke, in NC, or many other educational institutions) have a different mission than the sports ortho docs. These teaching docs have more experience with injuries that the ortho docs don't treat, since those docs refer their cases to the teaching docs.
i liked what Tania said about Mayo Clinic, because they are excellent , but too far for me.
They are probably better than the teaching hospitals because I have heard their surgeons are not compensated based on the number of cases they do. Also, I have heard the docs work as a team and do not have a competitive environment of churning out as many surgeries as possible.
It is sad that docs don't ever say things like: ""I do not treat this kind of case but if you go to facility xyz they definitely do treat this."" It is easier to say the stuff about age, or athletic level as their method to side-step.
Why should they do this surgery and have liability risk when they can do a couple hip replacements in less time?
I hope you find someone within a distance you can travel to.
I guess we all have to be our own advocates and insist on MRI (or whatever) to try and define what is wrong with us rather than assume the doc we see will work in our best interest.
I think we were all raised to believe the docs want to help us, but they all will have their financial motivations , and liability risk is part of that.
I wish you the best and hope you can update us in your doc search.
The doc that is helping me is a hip doc that is under 40 but indicated he had done more than 25 of these avulsion surgeries.
The only other doc I found that knew how to do them was older and had only done 5 cases. He was in a sports ortho practice.
Blessings and best of luck to you,
Wally 🍌 Whooooops!
PS1- Yes, I make fun of myself for falling into a split tossing a frisbee on an old slick tennis court
PS2- I am pretty confident in my assumptions about docs motivations. I know I could be wrong becaus I have not lived in their shoes. However, I have seen quite a bit that leads me to my conclusion. My wife agrees and she is smarter than I about why people do the things they do, so I trust her judgement more than mine on these matters.

Your Dr is NOT correct in telling you you will be fine in 2 months. This can be a life changing injury that needs to be addressed

"Hi H4C!
It sounds like you have been through something none of us have- artificial hip implant, then problems , then removal/replacement. Wow. Sorry to hear that.
I can imagine docs getting $ incentives (and working within a legal conflict of interest ) installing prosthetics that they are involved in developing/promoting .
I really can't imagine a fix. I can see the dr and companies point of view...... but, from the patient point of view I sometimes feel like we are glorified test subjects , being sold that joint replacement (or other challenging surgeries) are no big deal....
Was your situation within a major university health system?
I have much experience being a patient in a huge university health system.
The health system promotes themselves vigorously with commercials to convey that their health care is ""cutting edge.""
Funny way to describe a caring healthcare system!
I've found that the docs main mission is to teach their students and improve the prosthetics which they may be developing.
I really feel like the patients are a necessary complication for the docs to have to deal with since their mission is educating their student docs and Improving surgical methods and prosthetics under development.
I can understand why these docs only have limited patience to help their patients.
It has to be easier to dismiss the patient who is in pain or has many questions since this could imply the doc could have done a better job during surgery or in clinic.
Any doc in a teaching hospital has to have some amount of ego having a flock of ""baby docs"" in tow.
The easiest path for docs like this may be to act like the patient is the problem.
I do not know as much about sports medicine docs in private practice. I am sure there are many good ones .
Best of much not being pigeon holed by your health card team and finding a way to get the docs to listen.
My wife taught me these methods to deal with the doc and get the best care from them .
I needed this input from her because she said it works better to :
Act a little dumb when you see them because they get defensive if you act too educated
Believably Demonstrate that you value their input and guidance
Appeal to their wisdom
I have found it has helped me.
I want to share a quote from the tediously long voicemail loop within this health system on-hold greatest hits:
""Be sure to ask about our minimally invasive , cutting edge spine surgeries ....""
That is a really telling advertising slogan Indicative of the systems sensitivity !
Or..... maybe I am too sensitive?!

"Hello all,
I am a 24F. Tore 2/3 (biceps femoris and Semitendinosus). Misdiagnosed for a year. Tendons retracted by 10 cm. Fully active previously, competitive figure skater and snowboarder. This injury completely changed my life. I had chronic reconstructive surgery with Dr. Chris Larson in Mayo Clinic, Minnesota in Jan 2015. My function is significantly better. I would suggest surgery with him. No complications. I still have pain, and my function isn’t nearly as good as it was before. I still get sore and probably some tendinitis, given I still snowboard. I would 100% suggest the surgery if you want to be active past walking, and your injury was as severe as mine (assuming most of yours are). Recovery took me about a year. Granted I do have age on my side. Anyway, you’re all welcome to ask me questions.

"Tania,
Did the surgeon you saw indicate how much of your ongoing symptoms are due to the long period that went by between the injury and the surgery ,versus the severity of the injury, or a combination of factors?
Do you have nerve pains, and wee these worse initially after surgery.
(I have some nerve pain, my retraction was only 4cm, and my surgery was only a week ago, 5 weeks after injury)
As an athlete, it is very sad and disturbing you were misdiagnosed. What did they tell you after your injury? (You've seen what they tell the older people : ""unless you are an athlete it isn't worth fixing...""
Please tell us what the docs at Mayo Clinic are like. I have heard they often work as a team and have a better standard of care than most settings.
Keep up the strong will and good attitude!

"Hi Walt!
The surgeon did not indicate to me how much of my ongoing symptoms are related to the long period of wait time vs the severity of injury; however, the study that my surgeon did on these injuries indicated that the recovery is much better when seen acutely. If you would like to look up the study, just google Dr. Chris Larson ""Management of Chronic Proximal Hamstring Ruptures."" This seems to me that my symptoms are due to the long period before being correctly diagnosed. An achilles allograft was used because my tendon/muscle had atrophied so much that it would not stretch back up to the initial insertion point. This essentially lengthened my tendon as a whole. My muscle itself is now shorter, and I think that has a lot to do with my symptoms. If I had not waited, the allograft would not have been needed in the first place, as there would not have been any muscle atrophy.
I think if I had gotten the proper care initially, my ongoing symptoms would be much less severe, given that most of my symptoms are from lack of strength/control. I do not get nerve pain; however I can no longer sit on a bike seat, as that is where the surgical screws are with some sensitive scar tissue. Sitting for long periods of time will also irritate my hamstring at the insertion point (2+ hours). The only real pain I get is from over-use/tendinitis in other areas of my hip. Sometimes I will feel a pinch or a tug from the site itself, but thats when I know I really need to take a step back from activities to stretch and re-strengthen the muscle, as the tendon is being over-worked at that point. The muscle itself weakens very quickly.
It took me a long time to get over my anger and frustration with the MULTIPLE physicians I saw that dismissed me. Sometimes I wonder if it has to do with the fact that I am a minority female... but thats another issue entirely... I was told that it wasn't needed, that it was just a sprain, and that I would recover in a few months. 10 months later in PT, there was no improvement; however, my body did compensate well, as I could walk easily, climb up and down stairs (even though more difficult than usual), and walk up and down steep hills (again with more difficulty). When I was finally diagnosed, the docs said that they normally wouldn't do surgery, that they had never seen this injury before, and that I should continue doing PT. They said it was likely that I would not snowboard or figure skate again. I pushed back and they sent me to another doc where he sent me to Dr. Larson.
The docs at mayo clinic were very helpful and responsive. I had both Dr. Larson, his PA, and his anesthesiologist taking good care of me, as well as multiple nurses and doctors prior and during care. I flew up there from VA. At the time, Dr. Larson was the only one that I could find that had actually done the chronic reconstruction surgeries (2014). Dr. Larson and his associates are accustomed to having patients from all over, and they knew very much what to do (the next pt he had was from Saudi Arabia). The nurse followed up with me regularly after surgery via phone. I was also given a local ortho to follow up with, who was updating Dr. Larson as I recovered.
Thank you! Let me know if you have any other questions. Good luck in recovery, and stay positive! It's a long road, but I can't tell you how amazing it felt to do my first squat after 2.5 years of being inactive and then being able to get back on my snowboard (definitely had some tears in my eyes!!).

"Hi Tania, I don't blame you for being upset , and you are really smart to figure out some way to let it go.
I am 58 and it took me at least until 55 to learn to let things go.
Since your surgery was more than 3 years ago, I'd love to know about when you didn't feel odd nerve sensations.... 9 months after surgery?
That first squat at the 2.5 year mark must have been something!
I Wouldn't be surprised at all if the docs didn't listen to you because of being a ""two-fer"".... a woman who is non-white, but also, you are young so technically you are a 3-fer.
Doctors get p***y with me because I am super curious and love to understand everything I can. Invariably, docs will say To me: ""are you an engineer? You guys make the worst patients, so
Many questions... argh.""
I have a couple ideas you probably thought of. You can make a custom seat cushion with custom cutouts for the sit bones.
This might provide significant comfort enhancements so you can get past the 2 hour sitting mark and even have less pain.
You can also make a custom bike seat that has the same properties. I am thinking , if you know the space between the sit bones and create openings that are between 2-3"" , have layered memory foams of different densities covering it, you will eliminate most of the point loading where those sutures attach.
I do not know how to PM in this interface but if you do, I'd be happy to share my ""annoying-engineer"" ideas.
I also want to tell you a couple of great stories about dr experiences but there is
No way I will put it out on the web. My Mom was with me for one , and my wife for the other.
It has taken me so so long to realize that most docs are not that different than a car mechanic or a plumber. The main difference is, if a tradesman messes something up the customer sometimes has recourse to get the problem resolved. If a doctor screws something up , we patients seldom have recourse.
If some of the docs I have dealt with went to get their car serviced and received the same kind of care the doc provides to his patients the doc would have a fit! ""This wasn't diagnosed correctly! That wasn't fixed! This is unconscionable!""
When the doc does it, they duck, cover, and can snidely explain that what they do is ""an
Art."" No wonder it is called ""practicing medicine .""
I have had some good docs , but so many marginal ones. My wife and I joke when we see another doc : ""I think this one was getting Cs and Ds. Low end of the bell curve.""
Statistics dictate that we should not expect most docs to be the As and Bs of the class. There are more Cs and Ds out there!
Best wishes,

"Walt ... You are absolutely spot on with your defination of the differences between doctors and mechanics. I spent many years of coping with some misdiagnosed joint and tendon pain and ended up with a recalled hip implant because the mechanics in the design failed. This particular design was implemented to help with the ease the installation for the ""Artsy Talented Surgeon"". He would take less time and receive a huge donation $ from the Manufacturer for using their design.
Sorry to all the engineers out there but a bit of mechanical failure was in the design causing my hip replacement components to be subject inumerable problems / pain and led to another hip joint replacement and more complications.
Maybe we can all get together and write a book on doc's with all ""A"" reports on their web sites. I once wrote a truthful negligent report on a orthopedic surgeon Yelp site grading the surgeon with -5 ?? on the review page. Wouldn't you know it the next hour I checked the site and my review was deleted. Surprise! 😱
I am very sorry you and Tania had to cope with so much of the muddied waters. Dismissal of patients who have serious issues are in my state catorgized as pain medication seekers. You know those opiates that help releive pain! Yet we are not given or ask for pain meds just want to have our lives back and find out why we are suffering??
I am very proud of you both for not giving up and becoming your own self advocate. Seems like we need to be detectives these days to find the long triad to recovery.

"Hi Walt!
Yeah its really difficult, and I'd be lying if I said I have completely let it go.
Could you be more specific about odd nerve sensations?
And that is actually really funny, because I studied biomedical engineering in college, I am also guilty of the tons of questions. Docs should be prepared for people to be asking questions... I think its only fair if they're going to be diagnosing and treating me.
Yeah I've thought about that but I don't even know where to start with the custom seating for bikes! I would be super interested in some ideas from you! And if I'm being honest, it's kind of embarrassing to be around my fully able bodied 24 year old friends, and I'm walking around with a butt cushion... haha. So I've been kind of sucking it up with that one... stupid reason I know.
And that is so very true, especially of ortho docs. I'm planning on going into medicine myself, and from my experience shadowing/my own patient experiences, some of them can be very careless, especially if the patient isn't interesting enough of a case. I have also had some really good docs, and some that are just plain dismissive. It gets hard to have to stick up for yourself so much with this kind of stuff.

I had one region that was totally numb after surgery but it was right away. That slowly cam e back over a couple of months ( I am post op 5 months)
The burning ,well I had my share. What I am wondering is how restricted are you? I was in a brace and needed to lay down most of time for 6 weeks .
Whenever I moved a little too much or ""wrong"" the burning increased. I was told the body is trying to build scar tissue. When you disrupt that it burns, the body then sends in fluid which causes more discomfort.
Wonder if you are trying to move around too much??? It takes cwry very little to p**s it off in the early days and weeks of recovery.

"Thanks Michelle, I really appreciate your note and insight.
I think you are right, maybe I am moving around too much.
I should ask everyone :
What limitations did your doctor put you on , and for what period of time?
What kinds of nerve pain have you experienced and how did it change over time?
My doc said I can 50% weight bare and that I can use a rollator walker on wheels. I didn't want my wife to always have to wait on me so I have been shuffling around my house using the rollator.
Maybe this is too much activity.
Also, he has me in a knee brace that can move from 20-90 degrees, maybe that is too much.
I also sometimes sit on a padded recliner even though it hurts. Perhaps this is also irritating the repair area.
Thanks everyone for sharing what your doc told you , what your experiences are, and your opinion about where her I am overdoing it and being clueless while I overdo it!

Injury: july 2013
Surgery: Jan 2015
Used an allograft to reconnect. 10 cm retracted.
I was on bed rest for a few days after surgery with a brace placed at 90 degrees with no movement. After that, given crutches, stayed at 90 degrees for two weeks (non-weightbearing). Had a follow up to take out the stitches. I remember being incredibly sore, and had some numbness/stinging sensations. After two weeks at 90 degrees, brace moved to 60 degrees (again non-weightbearing with crutches). Two weeks after that, 30 degrees with movement allowed between 90 and 30 degrees, non weight-bearing with crutches. After two weeks at 30 degrees, I was allowed to take of the brace, and ween myself off the crutches. I would say I was full weight bearing at around 9 weeks after surgery. After that, I started physical therapy, which lasted for about a year.

"HAMSTRING AVULSIONS, Source
Hamstring injuries are common in athletes who participate in sports activities such as track, soccer, and basketball that involve running, The three hamstring muscles namely semitendinosus, semimembranosus and biceps femoris are at the back of the thigh and helps you bend (flex) your knee and extend your leg.
Injuries to the hamstring group of muscles can range from a minor strain to a complete tear. Avulsion injury occurs when the hamstring muscle tendon completely tears away from the bone. Sometimes, the tendon or ligament may even pull off a piece of bone along with it.
Hamstring tendon avulsions are caused by a sudden contraction of the hamstring muscle during strenuous exercise. A sudden jump, overstretch, or large sudden load to the muscle can increase your risk of hamstring avulsion injury.
Patients with hamstring avulsion injury will experience extreme pain, weakness, cramps while walking and running, and poor leg control, particularly while walking down a slope.
Hamstring avulsions occur rarely and are often difficult to differentiate from simple strains. Diagnosis is made through the symptoms and physical examination. During the physical examination, your doctor will examine your thigh for tenderness and bruising as well as check for signs of pain, swelling and weakness in the back of your thigh. Your doctor may order an X-ray to see whether the avulsed tendon has pulled away a small piece of bone and MRI scan to determine the severity of your injury.
Initial treatment for hamstring injuries involves rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE protocol); all assist in controlling pain and swelling.
Hamstring avulsion is a serious injury that may require surgery. During the tendon avulsion repair, hamstring muscles are pulled back to its normal attachment. Your surgeon cuts away any scar tissue from the hamstring tendon and then the tendon is reattached to the bone using staples or stitches. If there is a complete tear within the muscle, the torn ends are reattached using stitches.
After surgery, you may need to use crutches and a brace to protect and keep your hamstring muscle in relaxed position. Your doctor will recommend physical therapy which involves gentle stretching exercises in order to restore normal function. Rehabilitation period of at least 3 to 6 months may be needed before returning to athletic activities.

"Hi Summer!
From what I understand, it don't think that your hamstring will heal well without surgery. the detached muscles will probably atrophy due to lack of use. The hamstring not only has to do with strength, but control of your leg overall. Once the muscles atrophy, its even more difficult to get surgery later. I felt far from normal after my injury, and I honestly doubt you will be back to normal without surgery. As michelle said, make sure to get a second opinion. Good luck and try to stay positive!

Get another opinion. There are other beneficial things they do when they reattach, for example, my Dr debreeded some of the bad tissue so that healthier tissue had a chance to replace the bad during my recovery.

The sooner they reattach ,ultimately the better. Less time for atrophy to set in.
I was detached 3 months before they determined it was not just a bad tear. It was 4 1/2 months post avulsion before I had my surgery.
I had atrophy and denervation. The recovery is very slow, but I work as a hair colorist/stylist and was back to work within 2 months.

So I that's that. He told me ok I'll see you in three weeks then and see how your doing. Just rest let it scar up then we'll start some physical therapy.

"How are you doing Joy?
I am one week behind you; my surgery was 3/19.
How is your numbness and pain?
Do you have a lot of swelling?
What limitations did your doc put you on?
Thanks-
Walt

"I'm 18 days PO and just had my first PT appt this morning. Dull pain and minimum numbness. Swelling seems to be going down. There's a lot of people with this injury, you can find them by going to Facebook and search for proximal hamstring injury and surgery. Lots of people at different stages of surgery.

"Thank you Joy, and I hope that first PT visit was good. I guess the PT was mobilizing it and giving you gentle exercises.
Glad you have only full pain and minimum numbness. Had the pain and numbness been much greater earlier?
Did your doc tell you you could weightbear 50% (or at all) on the surgical side after the surgery ?
Did doc say you could use a walker or rollator if you bear a lot of the weight on your arms?
Maybe my stinging & burning and swelling are from overuse as Michelle suggested.
I am now back to crutches only to see if that chills out the pain.
I just joined that FB group; thanks for mentioning that earlier to another member.
I wish you well and appreciate hearing of your past, present, and future hammy status....

"48 years old active snowboarder, runner, tennis player. complete avulsion BOTH legs sprinting in a tennis game. Just had left leg done because the retraction was 4 cm. right leg at 2-3 cm. I am doing great!!! Off pain meds as of day 3 after surgery. Today is day 5 and I get to shower. I am getting along on the crutches ok..they are not the fastest mode of transportation. I am planning on getting the right leg done in a few months. I can sit on toilet and am back to regular bowel movements...the pain meds really will mess with that. PT starts Tuesday, am curious to see what they will have me do. I am trying to find out about what I can expect as far as walking as soon as possible. Keeping up with a good attitude and so grateful to have modern medicine!!

"hello. i had my 3 tendons torn - about 4/5 cm off. lots of conflicting medical advice.
I had the surgery which merely´pulls up the tendons do they scar at the right spot providing better support for the muscle and the entire leg. I am very happy I did it within the 3 weeks. lt is my strong leg as I have e some knee problems on the other leg and I am sure having the operation (@51) will also save le lots of issues later on in life. back to same level of sport as before.
this forum really helped me so I wanted to write. good luck

"Hi All
I too had complete avulsion of all 3 and 10 cm retraction. Misdiagnosed then told too late for surgery in Ireland. Has anyone had delayed surgery in UK or Finland and how was it. I am functional but experiencing numbness now in foot and leg and also altered Gait. Cant walk that far and I am 11 month post injury. Worried about the issues further down the line if i dont have surgery but thought of surgery at 12 months in is also scary as i already have nerve and numbness issues.
Any advice from anyone who has rehabbed successfully either way?
