"I'm not even sure I have depression, I think this may just be 'me'.
I have always been pretty useless socially, but have had a normal upbringing, no horrible experiences, have gone through education fine and even got jobs but I've never enjoyed life, never really cared and normally feel like I'm not really worth anything and, inevitably enventually, will become a burden.
I'm not going to be dramatic and say I'm going to end it, it sounds so pathetic (no offence intended to anyone) but I have thoughts of 'going' or even dreams that I could die 'blamelessly' thorugh accident or illness. Selfish I know.
I have a cycle. Get job, put on confident easy going persona, get physically tired from doing that, lose energy to maintain job, focus on negative, leave job in some form (fired/quit). Friends are much the same, play easy going fun, can't keep it up, lose or push them away. Relationships, get attracted to ones who need help, help them in anyway I can, get to a point where I feel I am no more use so should go as they'd be ultimately better off.
So, currently I've quit my job as a teacher, couldn't take it - always something to improve and with my way of thinking that just sounds like constantly someone telling you you're useless (and it backing up your own thoughts anyway) but even though I liked aspects of my job I don't think I had a passion like I see in others. I felt I'd let everyone down so disappeared, my partner/ parents got me through immediate days after my sudden departure from work and saw Doc who was nice enough - put me on medication which seemed to do very little - even after a few months. In fact it only had negative side effects so about three weeks ago I stopped taking them completely. I also started seeing a CBT person about three/four session ago but this feels like it's doing nothing at all either, we talk, I'm honest as I can be but there is some element of being 'public' and putting on that face/ jokey responses.
I dip between a wish to not be around that is forever there and seems to be backed up with wholly logical reasons that people genuinely struggle to refute to absolutely crashing panic attacks/ given up when my 'theories' are proved.
I know this sounds odd, but I don't even have the will to get 'better', largely because I don't think I can. I am just 'me'. I am negative, boring and even if it is all just selffullfillng profecies - it's still me who has done that. I'm not blaming life, or others or anything else.
A lot of the posts I read on here seem to have good reason; PTS, loss, finances etc - does anyone have no 'good' reason?
I just feel I'm never going to be happy, I am soon to be much a burden on those around me (my gf) and that, in the long run, it'd be better for all if I just went. I know my family and gf love me - but time heals, life would get better and people move on. In the long run I'm sure it wouldn't effect my family and 100% sure my gf would be better off.
Not sure if there is an answer for this, just writing. I'm not angry, I'm not hurt, I'm not even sad as such, I'm just tired...

"You have taken the first step and that is asking for help. It can always be worse. It sounds like you are extremely depressed. I too have had problems keeping jobs and friends.. when I got to the point to where I wanted to end my life, I did something that I've always wanted to do. I went skydiving and all my big problems became very small. I think facing death in an indirect way helped turn my life around. Every time I got to the point to where I was depressed I would go skydiving again. About seven years ago I didn't think it to get worse but I got Dystonia torticollis, that's where your muscles start pulling the wrong way. My head lies on my shoulder and I'm in extreme pain all the time. In between being depressed and getting torticollis I actually became successful until I got torticollis. Please try skydiving jumping out of a plane will help. And remember it can always get worse. If you realize how lucky you are and that ""the big problems in life are really not as big as what you think"" I am now broke and I'm worse off than I've ever been but I feel everyday is a gift. Even though I'm in extreme pain and my body is distorted now for some reason I want to live every minute that I possibly can. Just remember it could always be worse. Merry Christmas

"What a fantastic answer, but also a really bad one!! Let me explain...
​Firstly I'm very pleased to see you are happy and treat every day as a gift. Obviously I'm sorry you have such daily physical problems but I'm sure that makes you even happier you did the skydiving when you did. I'm really pleased what you did worked for you and it's encouraging to find a rare example of someone who has somewhat defeated depression even if the cost of that has been quite extreme.
​But then on the same hand, not recognising how lucky I am isn't the problem, it's knowing that I am and I'm still not feeling good which then further compounds how bad I feel about myself. I know I'm luckier than most, I know things could be worse, I live in an affluent country with water on tap, have good health and had a normal upbringing with no major traumas. So knowing this makes me feel EVEN worse about myself. I see I'm selfish, and ungrateful, and petty and all other words - why can't I just be happy?
​I've put my life on the line a few times, both within the safety confines of organised activities and on the less controlled activities I may do myself - it doesn't help me. Being near death doesn't impact me positively or negatively - I'm almost apathetic to it.
​And this is why your answer is both fantastic and bad! For you, and others it may work. You are obviously an inspiration to lots of people not only for the physical issues (which are almost a separate issue) but for the fact you have altered your way of thinking in a positive manner. But they also highlight how everyone's issues are unique - and as well intentioned, and even correct, your view that it could be worse it, that can actually make people feel worse.
​If we all focused on 'it could be worse' they'd be very few people in this world who could complain, unfortunately it's not that simple. This depression doesn't care that I'm lucky, it just cares that I think badly of myelf and reminds me of it every day and actually accelerates when I speak to people who could argue they do have a good reason to feel bad. I know I don't - and that makes it even worse.
​Thanks for your reply, I hope I didn't come across aggressively! I'm very happy that you are happy and hope things improve if that's possible for you. Good luck, have a great Christmas and a lovely New Year.

"Well, from reading your stuff here it would appear that we think in a similar fashion. Quite obvious really, otherwise why was I searching for other's thoughts on 'being tired of life'!
Anyway, having read all of your posts here I'd like to say that I appreciate someone taking the time to punctuate as properly as someone can be reasonably expected to.
I read someone here say to get some 'less stressful' work like in a warehouse or something similar, well, let me tell that person that any and all work which involves interaction with other humans is highly stressful, incredibly tiring and seemingly ultimately pointless!
Not having the luxury of either family, friend or partner to bail me out I must work or sleep on the streets within weeks. No other options due to my inability to function as a normal human. Personal responsibility is a wonderful thing.
It is New Year's Day 2016 and thankfully that (oh such fun and loving) period of falseness is over for another 11 months! I wonder how many more there will be and will they all be quite so alone (not lonely) for me.
rsjg, you apparently have some free time on your hands during the days while the bread winner in your team is at work for you. You also sound as though you like to help people and don't currently have any excuse not to try something simple for someone else's benifit. So, what I want you to do with your loose end time is to research (get this right please) High Functioning Asperger's Syndrome for me. Now, I cannot pay you, you will purely be helping me out, there is no end to the research and all you get is satisfaction and something else to think about for a while.
How does this sound to you?
The reason I ask is purely that I don't have either the time or the inclination to do something for myself as I don't deserve the help from me that others receive without question, oh and the fact that High Functioning AS adults currently don't get diagnosed (labelled) due to them being too clever and the only so called 'real help' out there costs an arm and a leg, both of which I'd rather keep hold of thanks!
Please don't pick holes in my punctuation, grammar and sentence building (lack of) skills, I may have also once been a teacher, been measured by British Mensa and found to be an actual genius and have taken ages writing and re-writing this, but I still make mistakes.
At least Google - High Functioning Asperger's Syndrome, become a specialist and help people in the future to work smarter with my lifelong challenges.
Cheers and Happy New Year

"I had a few people on her write to me over Xmas/ New Year but needed to ignore them - too much energy was needed to focus on acting happy and normal around family!
​I wish I could talk to you more directly than on an open forum. I've said before, knowledge is a great thing - but it can also be a curse. You need to be particuarly careful self-diagnosing but also need to think whether this diagnosis is in any way helpful to you. Say you decide that you are HFAS - how does that help you? If you can't source help then it is just another meaningless semantic for feeling awful day to day.
​I've also mentioned that it is probably important to get outside your own head - think about doing things that stop you thinking about yourself. However, as a caveat, I also recognise doing anything (like talking to another human being as you rightly point out!) can be extrememly stressful.
​I'd never pick holes in others punctuation and grammar unless they were doing it to others! It's a forum, not a thesis! However if you have the time and pride to check your message back then maybe you do have the time to look at HFAS if it interests you.
​To be honest, knowledge is something I despise yet am addicted to so I will inevitably be searching HFSA after I've written this reply! But without an argument or focus it is impossible to really research a topic to any purpose. I will happily help others if I can (preferably from afar!) but not sure what I could do to focus your research on this matter and whether it'd even be of any benefit to you anyway.
​Like I said, there is certainly an interesting discussion to be had but unfortunately I doubt this is the place to do it effectively for you or I.
​Good Luck.

"Quick research, scan read. Told you I would... I definitely don't have HFSA. You may well have but it'd take more than a quick chat to establish that.
​As I'm sure you're aware, everyone is somewhere on the autistic spectrum and all the various labels that spin off that. Even the most 'normal' of people might feel particuarly calmed by a colour, or get irritated by a simple tapping noise. The issues arise when your 'quirks' impact on your life. Mine do for me, and yours sound like they do for you.
​I have had a ton of labels I have both researched or been told about that might fit my ways of thinking and acting but the conclusion I reached was that it was all kind of pointless - a label by its very nature is just a broad title to fit many people and when that comes to the brain it's a very pointless exercise. You might be able to group broken limbs in patients but with the head it's nearly impossible - there's too many bits that do or don't apply for every individual. Ultimately a title is only helpful to point you in the right direction to get you personalised help. And it HAS to be personalised.
​I think I have depression, with social anxiety. I have signs of bipolar, I get symptoms of SAD, I have trichotillomania, I have mild OCD that gets worse if I'm stressed, I have panic attacks, I over think everything, I have low self-esteem and no confidence, I feel suicidal most days and a million other mini-labels. Doesn't help me though. It's the classic 'what's in a name?'
​I hope you see my point. We sound very similar yet I would class myself as a people pleaser, I rarely sure emotion outside the house and am overly polite to even strangers. So whilst HFSA might apply in parts, it doesn't solve everything.
​Think about what you want from this title. How will it help you? You might be better focusing on the things that make you feel better, not labelling something that makes you feel bad.
Good luck.

Painful and going to take time to heal. You do what's required without a second thought. You think about it you convince yourself that rest and guidance is the key but you never need to question why that day you chose the short cut.
The brain however gets a rougher deal if that breaks. You know what you need to do because the experts tell you but why believe them ? Why ? Let's question and even if there right you question how. When. Why me.

"I pretty much felt like that most of my life. Moving from place to place whether it is work, friends, relationships or home. Living is just so tiring and it isn't fun or enjoyable. It took me a failed marriage which ended in the most hostile way possible to seek some help. I am slowly and beginning to admit that it is some form of depression. Haven't done the CBT though. Even if you don't think you are suffering from depression, try everything, you never know, something might work for you.

"""What is depression and what is just character?!""
I get the impression that you are highly sensitive, empathic, and have high ideals.
Let's be honest, there is more bad in this world than there is good. Consciously or not, we're all constantly being barraged with negative messages. And negative emotions have more staying power than fleeting feelings of joy. Your brain is more than likely over stimulated and is compensating / protecting you by dulling your emotions.
Think of a traumatic event that you have witnessed (car crash, violent scene in a movie, etc.). Your senses are on high alert, you question yourself as to whether you really saw and heard what just happened, you find yourself in shock.
Like shock, depression is a manifestation of our brain's self-protecting powers. It's by no means a comfortable state of being, it leaves one feeling 'flat' (to depress is to flatten), apathetic, tired. But it's an effective mechanism that shields us from feeling intense upset.
What you are describing rsjg, is typical depression. I think that you will find that you will cycle in and out of it throughout your lifetime. This is not a character weakness, as you come off as being very honest, insightful, caring, and intelligent.
I haven't lived in Brittain (I'm assuming that's where you're from) but here in the U.S. there is tremendous (and unrealistic) pressure to be happy all the time. Nobody can live up to that standard, and 'phonying up' (so others will be more comfortable around you) and living with self - deception is exhausting. If that doesn't rob one of a strong sense of self, depression surely will. The best that we should aim for is contentment.

"What a well written submission, and I hope it helped rsjg as it did me. For a long time I have tried to understand why moving to America at first excited me, then overwhelmed me (2 step daughters perhaps?) and then I began having anxiety attacks - something I never had before. You are right, and now, after going through being betrayed, and losing several loved ones, I see quite clearly the happy facade in California around me. It is, as you say, deadening, almost like living in a Stepford Wives movie where you don't fit in.
Your description of depression is also very clarifying. I think it was my only way to numb the pain of inadequacy and lost love. I wondered why i had lost my spirit which was once so strong, why I struggled to feel a sense of belonging .... anywhere. Why I looked at myself and wondered who I was.
Thank you for your wise words.

I don't have anyone to love me - no partner or kids (I am 60) so you are one up on me. I have 3 sisters and only 1 nephew. 1 sister (who I don't have or want any contact with) has 1 son. She is a snob. Out of my other 2 1 is a recluse and shuts herself away and the other is a thief who stole all our mothers money before she died. So I have no one who would truely miss me.

"I doubt you have no one, family is only one part. Work friends? Neighbours?
But, for the sake of discussion, if there is really no-one then in a way you know how to feel better and that gives you a lot of power. I don't even know how to be 'happy' and feel I should leave those around me before I drag them down too!
If you feel lonely, then be a little more proactive, join some clubs or groups etc. Without being offensive, you are a little older than me and there are a lot more clubs set up for your age group than mine that wouldn't be intimidating. I get expectations of sports clubs (loud bravado people!) or nightclubs etc where as I'm sure there are more suitable groups for you. Knowing what you want to make you happy is a great thing.
As for your family, you seem to want nothing to do with them. Great! Sorry, people on here may say that's sad etc or to try but it's your situation - if you simply don't get on then absolutely forget them. People survive without families all the time. Or you mentioned the recluse, maybe you need each other...
I sympathise, in case that didn't come across, so whilst I appreciate I have one on you by having a partner (although that can make you feel worse by the way in that you feel like a burden) you also have one on me knowing what will make you happy.
You don't need family/partner to feel loved. In fact family's love often feels more 'because you're family' than out of want. Friends are there purely because they want to be.

"Thanks for your reply rsjg. I do see on sister quite a lot and of course I do have friends - several close ones, drinking friends, casual friends etc. I am not working as can't get a job so am often lonely.
I do go to a social club for over 55's but don't do knitting! I play cards in one of them and attend a writers group. Despite my advanced age I do occasionally go to nightclubs you know....
I have quite a good social life and go out at least 3 evening a week playing darts and dommies with the lads at my local. I also go to bingo.
Oh and I certainly don't need my reclusive sister!!! You sound very young and I think you will find that us 'old folk' don't sit in a corner of a kitchen anymore knitting anymore and I hope you will be the same when you are old like me....
It doesn't follow that I know how to make myself happy so I don't know where you got that idea. I keep as busy as I can but what I was saying was I don't have love in my life or anyone really close to me. That makes me unhappy. No one would miss me that much if I wasn't here.

"Hi Hypercat, I really didn't mean any offence, I just meant you have more access to such activities due to your age. I bet most of the people in those activities you talk of are of similar age and are in similar situations due to unemployment, retirement etc. You may well be the youngest there but I'm sure you have plenty in common with them. In fact I'm envious! All I was trying to say is there isn't that social world more mid 30 year olds, you're kind of expected to be all sociable and loud. My one friend tried to get me to go to a craft course - he's ten years older than me, and he was youngest be 10 years! It doesn't mean its not pleasant to some degree but you do feel very 'odd one out'
I apologise if I jumped to conclusions based on your message but I maintain that with the active social life you live you have LOADS of people who would miss you. Love is not exclusively available from family and partners. You seemed to suggest this was why you were largely unhappy so I think you know what makes you tick; you miss a partner/ family bonds. I'm not going to be stupid enough to say 'fix it' then as it's never that simple, but knowing what would make you happy is a positive; at least it gives you a target.

"rsjg. There is not much more available to me because of my age then there is you. Many of the groups are for old people who want to knit and gossip. Nearly all of them have or did have partners, children and grandchildren and I don't so I don't have a lot in common with them.
Oh I do have loads of people who would miss me but no one who would be devastated. I still have lots of issues to do with intimacy and love which I don't think I will ever be able to solve so I don't think the partner thing is ever going to happen. I have accepted this now but still feel sad about it. Still that's life I guess. Thanks for your reply. xx

"I feel you have missed the point of the writer, and you are wrong about the clubs and activities - you have plenty no matter what age, but when you are depressed and have lost your confidence, it is incredibly hard to get up and do those things. Be gentle on us older folk - I am 58. It is a harsh climate out there if you are that age - your husbands seek young women, it's hard to find work, and your body and hormones are not playing well with your ego.

I know this sounds odd, but I don't even have the will to get 'better', largely because I don't think I can. I am just 'me'. I am negative, boring and even if it is all just selffullfillng profecies - it's still me who has done that. I'm not blaming life, or others or anything else.
A lot of the posts I read on here seem to have good reason; PTS, loss, finances etc - does anyone have no 'good' reason?
I just feel I'm never going to be happy, I am soon to be much a burden on those around me (my gf) and that, in the long run, it'd be better for all if I just went. I know my family and gf love me - but time heals, life would get better and people move on. In the long run I'm sure it wouldn't effect my family and 100% sure my gf would be better off.
Not sure if there is an answer for this, just writing. I'm not angry, I'm not hurt, I'm not even sad as such, I'm just tired...

"You have taken the first step and that is asking for help. It can always be worse. It sounds like you are extremely depressed. I too have had problems keeping jobs and friends.. when I got to the point to where I wanted to end my life, I did something that I've always wanted to do. I went skydiving and all my big problems became very small. I think facing death in an indirect way helped turn my life around. Every time I got to the point to where I was depressed I would go skydiving again. About seven years ago I didn't think it to get worse but I got Dystonia torticollis, that's where your muscles start pulling the wrong way. My head lies on my shoulder and I'm in extreme pain all the time. In between being depressed and getting torticollis I actually became successful until I got torticollis. Please try skydiving jumping out of a plane will help. And remember it can always get worse. If you realize how lucky you are and that ""the big problems in life are really not as big as what you think"" I am now broke and I'm worse off than I've ever been but I feel everyday is a gift. Even though I'm in extreme pain and my body is distorted now for some reason I want to live every minute that I possibly can. Just remember it could always be worse. Merry Christmas

"What a fantastic answer, but also a really bad one!! Let me explain...
​Firstly I'm very pleased to see you are happy and treat every day as a gift. Obviously I'm sorry you have such daily physical problems but I'm sure that makes you even happier you did the skydiving when you did. I'm really pleased what you did worked for you and it's encouraging to find a rare example of someone who has somewhat defeated depression even if the cost of that has been quite extreme.
​But then on the same hand, not recognising how lucky I am isn't the problem, it's knowing that I am and I'm still not feeling good which then further compounds how bad I feel about myself. I know I'm luckier than most, I know things could be worse, I live in an affluent country with water on tap, have good health and had a normal upbringing with no major traumas. So knowing this makes me feel EVEN worse about myself. I see I'm selfish, and ungrateful, and petty and all other words - why can't I just be happy?
​I've put my life on the line a few times, both within the safety confines of organised activities and on the less controlled activities I may do myself - it doesn't help me. Being near death doesn't impact me positively or negatively - I'm almost apathetic to it.
​And this is why your answer is both fantastic and bad! For you, and others it may work. You are obviously an inspiration to lots of people not only for the physical issues (which are almost a separate issue) but for the fact you have altered your way of thinking in a positive manner. But they also highlight how everyone's issues are unique - and as well intentioned, and even correct, your view that it could be worse it, that can actually make people feel worse.
​If we all focused on 'it could be worse' they'd be very few people in this world who could complain, unfortunately it's not that simple. This depression doesn't care that I'm lucky, it just cares that I think badly of myelf and reminds me of it every day and actually accelerates when I speak to people who could argue they do have a good reason to feel bad. I know I don't - and that makes it even worse.
​Thanks for your reply, I hope I didn't come across aggressively! I'm very happy that you are happy and hope things improve if that's possible for you. Good luck, have a great Christmas and a lovely New Year.

"Well, from reading your stuff here it would appear that we think in a similar fashion. Quite obvious really, otherwise why was I searching for other's thoughts on 'being tired of life'!
Anyway, having read all of your posts here I'd like to say that I appreciate someone taking the time to punctuate as properly as someone can be reasonably expected to.
I read someone here say to get some 'less stressful' work like in a warehouse or something similar, well, let me tell that person that any and all work which involves interaction with other humans is highly stressful, incredibly tiring and seemingly ultimately pointless!
Not having the luxury of either family, friend or partner to bail me out I must work or sleep on the streets within weeks. No other options due to my inability to function as a normal human. Personal responsibility is a wonderful thing.
It is New Year's Day 2016 and thankfully that (oh such fun and loving) period of falseness is over for another 11 months! I wonder how many more there will be and will they all be quite so alone (not lonely) for me.
rsjg, you apparently have some free time on your hands during the days while the bread winner in your team is at work for you. You also sound as though you like to help people and don't currently have any excuse not to try something simple for someone else's benifit. So, what I want you to do with your loose end time is to research (get this right please) High Functioning Asperger's Syndrome for me. Now, I cannot pay you, you will purely be helping me out, there is no end to the research and all you get is satisfaction and something else to think about for a while.
How does this sound to you?
The reason I ask is purely that I don't have either the time or the inclination to do something for myself as I don't deserve the help from me that others receive without question, oh and the fact that High Functioning AS adults currently don't get diagnosed (labelled) due to them being too clever and the only so called 'real help' out there costs an arm and a leg, both of which I'd rather keep hold of thanks!
Please don't pick holes in my punctuation, grammar and sentence building (lack of) skills, I may have also once been a teacher, been measured by British Mensa and found to be an actual genius and have taken ages writing and re-writing this, but I still make mistakes.
At least Google - High Functioning Asperger's Syndrome, become a specialist and help people in the future to work smarter with my lifelong challenges.
Cheers and Happy New Year

"I had a few people on her write to me over Xmas/ New Year but needed to ignore them - too much energy was needed to focus on acting happy and normal around family!
​I wish I could talk to you more directly than on an open forum. I've said before, knowledge is a great thing - but it can also be a curse. You need to be particuarly careful self-diagnosing but also need to think whether this diagnosis is in any way helpful to you. Say you decide that you are HFAS - how does that help you? If you can't source help then it is just another meaningless semantic for feeling awful day to day.
​I've also mentioned that it is probably important to get outside your own head - think about doing things that stop you thinking about yourself. However, as a caveat, I also recognise doing anything (like talking to another human being as you rightly point out!) can be extrememly stressful.
​I'd never pick holes in others punctuation and grammar unless they were doing it to others! It's a forum, not a thesis! However if you have the time and pride to check your message back then maybe you do have the time to look at HFAS if it interests you.
​To be honest, knowledge is something I despise yet am addicted to so I will inevitably be searching HFSA after I've written this reply! But without an argument or focus it is impossible to really research a topic to any purpose. I will happily help others if I can (preferably from afar!) but not sure what I could do to focus your research on this matter and whether it'd even be of any benefit to you anyway.
​Like I said, there is certainly an interesting discussion to be had but unfortunately I doubt this is the place to do it effectively for you or I.
​Good Luck.

"Quick research, scan read. Told you I would... I definitely don't have HFSA. You may well have but it'd take more than a quick chat to establish that.
​As I'm sure you're aware, everyone is somewhere on the autistic spectrum and all the various labels that spin off that. Even the most 'normal' of people might feel particuarly calmed by a colour, or get irritated by a simple tapping noise. The issues arise when your 'quirks' impact on your life. Mine do for me, and yours sound like they do for you.
​I have had a ton of labels I have both researched or been told about that might fit my ways of thinking and acting but the conclusion I reached was that it was all kind of pointless - a label by its very nature is just a broad title to fit many people and when that comes to the brain it's a very pointless exercise. You might be able to group broken limbs in patients but with the head it's nearly impossible - there's too many bits that do or don't apply for every individual. Ultimately a title is only helpful to point you in the right direction to get you personalised help. And it HAS to be personalised.
​I think I have depression, with social anxiety. I have signs of bipolar, I get symptoms of SAD, I have trichotillomania, I have mild OCD that gets worse if I'm stressed, I have panic attacks, I over think everything, I have low self-esteem and no confidence, I feel suicidal most days and a million other mini-labels. Doesn't help me though. It's the classic 'what's in a name?'
​I hope you see my point. We sound very similar yet I would class myself as a people pleaser, I rarely sure emotion outside the house and am overly polite to even strangers. So whilst HFSA might apply in parts, it doesn't solve everything.
​Think about what you want from this title. How will it help you? You might be better focusing on the things that make you feel better, not labelling something that makes you feel bad.
Good luck.

"Well let's try simplify things yer take a short cut home and trip and break your ankle.
Painful and going to take time to heal. You do what's required without a second thought. You think about it you convince yourself that rest and guidance is the key but you never need to question why that day you chose the short cut.
The brain however gets a rougher deal if that breaks. You know what you need to do because the experts tell you but why believe them ? Why ? Let's question and even if there right you question how. When. Why me.

There is a simple answer for you to feel what others feel but I personally think you should stay where you are and that is to live for the next breath.
You however seem to know this and some so I'm guessing you feel similar to me. The answer for you is not to concentrate on the whys his and why not but to keep on doing what your doing and compliment yourself for it as your making the world a better place

"I'm not even sure I have depression, I think this may just be 'me'.
I have always been pretty useless socially, but have had a normal upbringing, no horrible experiences, have gone through education fine and even got jobs but I've never enjoyed life, never really cared and normally feel like I'm not really worth anything and, inevitably enventually, will become a burden.
I'm not going to be dramatic and say I'm going to end it, it sounds so pathetic (no offence intended to anyone) but I have thoughts of 'going' or even dreams that I could die 'blamelessly' thorugh accident or illness. Selfish I know.
I have a cycle. Get job, put on confident easy going persona, get physically tired from doing that, lose energy to maintain job, focus on negative, leave job in some form (fired/quit). Friends are much the same, play easy going fun, can't keep it up, lose or push them away. Relationships, get attracted to ones who need help, help them in anyway I can, get to a point where I feel I am no more use so should go as they'd be ultimately better off.
So, currently I've quit my job as a teacher, couldn't take it - always something to improve and with my way of thinking that just sounds like constantly someone telling you you're useless (and it backing up your own thoughts anyway) but even though I liked aspects of my job I don't think I had a passion like I see in others. I felt I'd let everyone down so disappeared, my partner/ parents got me through immediate days after my sudden departure from work and saw Doc who was nice enough - put me on medication which seemed to do very little - even after a few months. In fact it only had negative side effects so about three weeks ago I stopped taking them completely. I also started seeing a CBT person about three/four session ago but this feels like it's doing nothing at all either, we talk, I'm honest as I can be but there is some element of being 'public' and putting on that face/ jokey responses.

"That's exactly how I felt the first time I had depression.
You don't need to have a life changing event or crisis to suffer depression. All you need is to not be producing enough serotonin in your brain. And you get this feeling you described of never truly enjoying life.
Anti-depressants can help but every person's brain is different so pills aren't a one size fits all sort of thing. It can take time to work, or even to find the right ones for you. I tried 2 before the third drug worked for me. But that is something you may want to discuss with your gp or counsellor.

"I read through your posts and found them to be really helpful as Ive suffered from anxiety and depression since 18 but never really knew what it was till recently. I decided recently to go back to a low amount of medication for anxiety and depression to hopefully keep me mellow as I broke down walking home from work one day and locked myself away for a while.
I suffered from my first major breakdown at 21 now 27, I started a new job as a teacher I was fine for the first 2 months but the more responsibility I took on the more i got stressed and anxiety and evently depression kicked in. I couldnt hold myself together and would go home and cry myself to sleep. I didnt want people to see me the way I was including my family and as I had moved to a new area in the UK only had a few friends I could confide in about what I was going through. Now when i look back on it i just wish i had been more wiser as seeked a second opinion as my doctor at the time just said i needed to get out more and see more friends. I was actually doing ok and enjoyed helping students with there studies and a lot of it was in my head. In the end my parents came down and took me home and looked after me and got me back to a normal state.
I just wanted to say give everything a try to keep yourself motiviated even if its going to the gym, catching up with a friend or trying a new job.
Id like to say am cured and never suffer from it but that would be lying. But once i got back on my feet i went travelling had some great experiences and now living in Australia.
Im not going to say am perfect now as I have another dilema in my life if I want to stay in Australia or go home as feeling not completly settled and I have been in Aus for nearly 5 years.
I just want to say your not alone and more people are suffering from anxiety/depression these days and you dont realise how common it is as people find it hard to dicuss as its your emotions and feelings. My doctor said it can depend on your personality and just what kind of person you and how you react to a situation.
Im not sure if this has helped and sorry if I have rambled on but I wish you luck in the future. I try and do one at least one new experience a week if thats trying a new restaurant, go on a date or meet a new person. I started hitting the gym more as its very cliche but feel so much better after going.
Hope you feel better soon. Have a listen to a band called the Album Leaf it helps me relax and close off my mind.

"Great message. Funnily enough I am/was a teacher too - but I think the environment is particularly toxic for those with is style of thinking (the profession is based around you/ the work never being good enough and what can you do to improve in the UK)
Catch 22 means that once this impacts you to the degree I had to quit my job, it means you cut off a social group and have no money for new experiences/ days out.
As regards you, I'd stay in Australia! I imagine it's a lot nicer when you have a crappy day opening the curtains to sunshine! Tthat'd make a little, but significant difference.
I'm not sure what I'll do now, think teaching is gone, can't see what I can do to keep me 'sane' as a career and find very little point in most things. I go to CBT but it just feels like we're talking about philosophy, my way of thinking hasn't changed one iota.
I had no reasons to think this way, I created them almost. Now I actually have no job etc. I am not a victim, I did it to myself. I think I have just given up, if I see 2015 I will be a little surprised as I imagine something will come along in next few months that will be enough to knock me fully over the edge; an unexpected bill, a worry how I'm impacting on my partner, a death in the family - something...

"Yeah teaching isnt for everyone and at that time in my life it wasnt. Have you thought about going travelling for extended time go work some jobs you never thought you would do. I worked on a farm stay and at one point cooked up a meal for 40 people which i never thought I could do and had to wash emus and feed osterichs lol. I know its hard to save but just cutting some luxarys out makes it a little easier.
Australia is beautiful place dont get me wrong and i have some amazing friends but do miss my family a lot as there all back in the UK. I only get to see them like 3 weeks a year and still want to travel more.
Maybe try and get a job with less stress like working in retail or a warehouse i know its not a career but sometimes we need to just do something different . Im sure you will be fine and try not to think the worse you need things to look forward to and not worry what will happen as thats no way to live your life.
I know how you feel as recently i left my job like yourself and have only had two weeks off and feel like i should be back at work but am slowly working on parts of my life with the time off I have. its good to have structure which am lacking at the moment as am going to bed late and getting up in the afternoons but now after 2 weeks of i need to change my ways and start getting a few things off my to do list as then i feel satisifed and happier for myself.
It funny how you mention about reason of been depressed there doesnt always need to be a root cause. I had a job with people that i got on with most of the time but as i sat there everyday at the same desk, talking to pretty much the same people with the same problems I realised there must be something else Id rather be doing and needed some time off to help realise what that will be. Im now looking at jobs where i can help people as i miss the one to one and want a job that i find rewarding. You just need to mix things up in life, there isnt one set route and if you want to do something different you can there is no wrong paths.

"I do love travelling but now, having just had to quit work, it isn't even possible for me to 'save' at all. Besides, my gf still has a job so I'm taking on my full time job of being a burden
Everything you write makes perfect sense. But the most relevant part is the tone; you seem to know everything isn't perfect but know your triggers and that there is good and bad. I was joking about staying in Oz, I fully recognise complications regarding family etc. Fortunately, or unfortunately, I now have no friends, no job, limited family (that I see rarely anyway) so am not tied to any geographical place. It's just gfs job that keeps me where I am.
I just struggle with people so much that I need a job that has little interaction. Don't get me wrong, most people would see me as easy going, relaxed, even funny at work but it is all such a tiring act I can never maintain it. I just spend my time thinking they don't really like me, or they think I'm an idiot or that I'm crap at my job. Think I just need to be a recluse!

"Yeah I understand I've worked a job for the last 9 months with the end goal to visit America which am now questioning if i should go as been pretty down recently, but have decided I would kick myself i didnt go. Its funny i just took a career quiz and it sugessted i should be a teacher or a councellor which a few people have suggested as I like talking and helping people.
I always thought I wanted a job where i dont work with people but after a while i would get bored and feel like it didnt matter and find the time goes slower than working with people.
Yeah im starting to realise when am going down hill and instead of asking the question why do i feel this way i do something about it hence going back on tablets before i get any worse as I know i would. Am close to my family we have a good relationship but i dont have many friends back in the UK and made some good ones in Australia that understand me, but i miss been able to chat to my family and do things together.
I completly understand about the act if you asked anyone previously i worked with they would say I was so happy with a smile on my face and looked so collected. It is hard especially when you have that little voice in your head saying whats the point, what would i rather be doing and your no good.
If i was there would take you for a pint or orange juice now am on the pills but its good to have somone to talk to i only have a few friends that have gone through what i have but can relate and make me feel better. I havent had a gf in a long time and do miss the company. Does she understand what your going through?

"We certainly have strong similarities, you seem to be a lot further along in your understanding of you and your triggers though. Going to Australia in the first place is quite an acheivement and you must be doing something right!
I too only really get enjoyment from helping others, the issue comes that when that 'problem' is solved I feel of no use and begin to withdraw. I have done it with friends and family. My girlfriend is a case in point, she had relationship, financial and work issues and I helped her solve all of these to be in a better place to the point now she considers everything to be pretty good in those departments, but I have nothing left to offer her. Worse still, I am now only going to be a burdn on her financially and emotionally and can offer her no decent future prospects. All that swims in my head is ""if you love them let them go"" as staying with her seems very selfish.
However, she is the first person who I have ever really shared this with. My past relationships completed the cycle! She understands as much as one can and is very supportive but I feel that her patience must run out eventually (she's a teacher so she does have a lot!) and she shouldn't have to deal with this anyway.
If I were you I'd visit America. Not sure where you're going but if you have the means then do it. If nothing else it is something to look back on one day and think 'wow, I did that' and gives you that ton more of info to talk about with friends, strangers, future partners that can fill those awkward moments when you're not sure what to say! You've lived abroad, nearly everyone would say that's pretty cool!
Cheers for the offer of a drink ha ha! But I'm so crap I'd probably just put it off and hope to be left alone! The lovely thing about the internet is it is so anonymous even I don't mind being honest. The second I meet someone I'm worrying I'm boring them, annoying them etc! Even my CBT doc!
I wish I could find just one positive to focus on. I really can't. The only one I should have (my gf) I twist to make it one of the biggest negatives - me being a burden to her. I'm not fun, I'm not confident, I now have no job, I have cr*p future financially, I can never acheive in basic things like house buying etc (I've never even owned a car in my name!) because every time I get myself on an even keel I sabotage it best I can, waiting for the disaster to hit.

"Yeah my family remind me how much an achievement it is but i feel like am missing a lot of family time which i do crave and a Greggs Sausage Roll .
I dont think you should look at it as burdening her I'm sure you both have fun and its great you helped her and now shes helping you till you find another job. I'm sure something will come up and know how you feeling as am trying to find a temp job for the next few weeks until I go away. You just need to do little things and am sure she will appreciate.
I used to date a teacher when I was teaching as well and she totally got what I was feeling and was nice to have someone to confide in. I think teaching is a hard career its more of a lifestyle than a job.
Ive decided to go on my trip to America but have shortened my trip to 4 weeks so cant wait as am catching up with a friend who lives in New York. Im quite lucky that i can travel but have made sacrifices to be able to do it as often as i like. I dont have a car either, i only started doing lessons this year but the day I failed my exam i was also going under for general surgery as they found a mole that they thought could have been cancerous my head wasnt in a right place for the test.
Im sure you wouldnt bore me and sure you have some fun stories from your teaching days. Have you always been a teacher?
You just need to focus on getting better thats number one if thats trying a different type of medication then give that a try. I was on one type over here that made me so much worse and then i tried one with a lower dosage and helped me mellow out. It sucks that we feel this way, I didnt get up till like the 5 pm today as i felt that bad just didnt want to see anyone or leave my bed. Ive just started back on my meds and i know this is usual and just getting a shower and going out seems like am climbing Everest. I just over think things and always have, I wish i didnt and were just like other people that seem to be relaxed most of the time. I think about the future a lot as been single for over 8 years, dont really know what i want to do as a career as want to get out of IT, dont even know if i want to stay in Australia. I sometimes think there must be more to life than this you know just working, meeting someone, kids and buying a house which i know sounds childish and then i go back to thinking about travelling the fun and exciting times i had meeting new people constantly, the random jobs and waking up sometimes in a new part of the country it was so hard going back to a routine and still know i preferd the travelling lifestyle. Didnt mean to ramble but trust me we all think and worry about the future, just got to keep plodding on and making decisions we feel are the best .
What does your girlfriend say when you tell her you feel like a burden?
Hope im not been too intrusive.

"Hi, a late response to your post,I just really felt the need to reply. So much of what you said resonates with me, actually all of it does. The feeling like a burden thing, especially to my husband who is a fully functioning member of society who although sympathetic doesn't really get how others aren't so I can't shake the feeling that I'm dragging him down and why on earth would he want to hang around. The day to day struggle to perform simple tasks ie make a phone call, deal with the plumber, go to the shops for food. I could go on forever with my feelings but really I just seem to be someone whom life is just to hard for. And like you, it's for no good reason.
personally I'm over it, I feel like when I die I'll just breathe a giant sigh of relief and say thank god that's over.
Really I just wanted to say thanks for your post and to the others that have replied that they are in the same boat.
It helps to know that somewhere out there, there is someone who gets it and doesn't think you're at all weird.
I wish you all the best on your journey

"Thanks for the reply, its nice to know you're not alone isn't it? However, it'd be nicer if people said it got any better! I hate the idea that this is forever, like an alcoholic or something!
I hope you haven't given up; I don't know how you just 'get over it', for good or bad! I have no spiritualty (I almost envy those who do!) so am under no illusions that it gets better after life but, much like someone in constant physical pain, I feel like I should be allowed to just give up without guilt.
I fully empathise with your issues, they sound identical! I beat myself up a little more as, being a man, society expects you to step up - think I get weird looks when the gf is dealing with everything!
I wish you luck with your future too - I hope you are doing something to try and fight it as I think without at least trying Meds/ Talk therapy etc then giving up in your head can easily turn in to giving up 'properly'.

"I understand exactly what you mean Ihm88. That's how I feel as well. I have always found life hard work as well and nothing has come easy for me. I wish something would for a change :d
I am 60 now and am tired, tired of fighting, and fairly tired of living but hey ho I have made it this far so some credit is due I guess.
I am just living now to make sure I get the pension I deserve after working all my life. Can't get it til 65 (hate the barstewards who changed that). I am determined to get my money's worth and live til at least 96 :d x

"I'm not even sure I have depression, I think this may just be 'me'.
I have always been pretty useless socially, but have had a normal upbringing, no horrible experiences, have gone through education fine and even got jobs but I've never enjoyed life, never really cared and normally feel like I'm not really worth anything and, inevitably enventually, will become a burden.
I'm not going to be dramatic and say I'm going to end it, it sounds so pathetic (no offence intended to anyone) but I have thoughts of 'going' or even dreams that I could die 'blamelessly' thorugh accident or illness. Selfish I know.
I have a cycle. Get job, put on confident easy going persona, get physically tired from doing that, lose energy to maintain job, focus on negative, leave job in some form (fired/quit). Friends are much the same, play easy going fun, can't keep it up, lose or push them away. Relationships, get attracted to ones who need help, help them in anyway I can, get to a point where I feel I am no more use so should go as they'd be ultimately better off.
So, currently I've quit my job as a teacher, couldn't take it - always something to improve and with my way of thinking that just sounds like constantly someone telling you you're useless (and it backing up your own thoughts anyway) but even though I liked aspects of my job I don't think I had a passion like I see in others. I felt I'd let everyone down so disappeared, my partner/ parents got me through immediate days after my sudden departure from work and saw Doc who was nice enough - put me on medication which seemed to do very little - even after a few months. In fact it only had negative side effects so about three weeks ago I stopped taking them completely. I also started seeing a CBT person about three/four session ago but this feels like it's doing nothing at all either, we talk, I'm honest as I can be but there is some element of being 'public' and putting on that face/ jokey responses.
I dip between a wish to not be around that is forever there and seems to be backed up with wholly logical reasons that people genuinely struggle to refute to absolutely crashing panic attacks/ given up when my 'theories' are proved.
I know this sounds odd, but I don't even have the will to get 'better', largely because I don't think I can. I am just 'me'. I am negative, boring and even if it is all just selffullfillng profecies - it's still me who has done that. I'm not blaming life, or others or anything else.
A lot of the posts I read on here seem to have good reason; PTS, loss, finances etc - does anyone have no 'good' reason?
I just feel I'm never going to be happy, I am soon to be much a burden on those around me (my gf) and that, in the long run, it'd be better for all if I just went. I know my family and gf love me - but time heals, life would get better and people move on. In the long run I'm sure it wouldn't effect my family and 100% sure my gf would be better off.
Not sure if there is an answer for this, just writing. I'm not angry, I'm not hurt, I'm not even sad as such, I'm just tired...

"Thats emotional flatness and it is depression. You sound like you've got a lot going for you, plenty of work experience, a girlfriend. I get that you can't enjoy anything, maybe talk to your doctor about getting another prescription? Sometimes certain medications work better than others. Regular exercise is good eg running. Happiness is a concept which is chosen. Try to see the brilliant person that you are and how much you've already done. See you feeling discontent with your occupation as a chance to do something about it. Think about what sort of job you'd really want to do. The problem is we grow up around the news which is often a negative source of information. Mindfulness may be of help to you, meditation could help too.

"I just googled ""I am tired of life"" and came across your discussion. I read your initial entry and thought I was reading about myself. I thought you stated your position extremely well and showed a tremendous amount of insight.
I also feel like my partner/wife would be better off without me. I know it. I have given up on relationships and have very few friends left. I wished I had an answer but even if I feel like I have an answer, it doesn't mean I will follow it simply because I am tired of trying. About the only three things get me somewhat excited are loooking forward to my next bike tour, my dog, and volunteering which gives me a good dose of perspective. Except for spending time with my do, doing the other 2 are requiring more and more effort.
I feel like I am fanning the flames instead of trying to help so I will stop. I hope you and others with the same situation will find some relief.

"I have read the replies and sympathise with you all, despite it being some time since I wrote the original post. Unfortunately little changes.
Paulsinbc you sound very similar! I'm impressed you can volunteer, I struggle with people and then somehow feel worse as I think I should be able to cope compared to people who have REAL problems. I've never felt hard done by or unfortunate - my problems are me!
However, you're right, there is an element of fanning the flames! The reason I've largely stopped looking at this site is I don't see a benefit for me or anyone else. I recognise some may get comfort from support from like minded people, or signposted to suitable resources or recognise symptoms of PTS or similar, but for me all I read is people who live with it forever with no answers and that in itself is depressing.
People say knowledge is power, but I find it to be a curse. The more you know, the more you realise your insignificance, the hopelessness of situations and the reality of the world rather than the rose-tinted 'it'll all work out in the end' view we're told to believe. I really struggle with the inability of professionals to accept that some people don't succeed, some people do fail, some people aren't talented, some people aren't nice - why can't that be me? It's no different than saying ""it can't happen to me"".
So for that reason I'm very much keeping this site at arms length. I'd unrealistically hoped for advice or signposting or, ridiculously, a miracle cure but it's more a gathering for people to support each other with knowing nods or virtual hugs. I recognise the support that may give to others but for me, it just makes me feel worse.

"Hi rsjg, I'm new here, so its strange to see that 8 months have passed since you started this thread. I want to ask how things have been during the last 8 months. I also have lots of questions about how things have moved in your life (internally and externally), even relating to any treatment or recovery processes.
Have you come any closer to deciding which aspects of your experience might be depression and which may be character?
Have you found ways to feel less like a burden?
What decisions did you make regarding work and relationships and where have you found suppot during the 8 months?
When you wrote initially, you said you weren't looking for answers, but now you admit that you had hoped for advice and signposting, and felt disappointed at the input from this website. Well, I was quite glad to read through your post and the responses as I felt there was a lot there to provide some direction and inspiraton. I think your hope for advice and signposting is quite realistic, looking through the various responses.
You talked before about cycles of mood? Is that something which is still going for you? How does that work in your life?

"What is it with my compulsion to reply despite my last comment?!
Yeah 8 months, feels both more and less. Unfortunately I doubt I will either give you insightful answers or even a nice positive slant on my response - you have been warned!
Little has changed. I tried drugs, didn't work, I tried therapy, too much religion and not willing to try again - a weird catch 22 in where you need to ask for help but are afraid of talking to people even day to day. Friends are nonexistent, I quit my job and haven't returned. I still feel like a burden to those around me, and how ever much they care it doesn't excuse it - in fact it makes it worse. I can't escape feeling that if I was a good person then I'd protect them from me - if you were highly infectious with a deadly disease would you hug your family? So internally and externally, very much status quo. I'm still here, slightly surprisingly.
It is fair to say I'm confused as to my wants and beliefs about my situation. One day it's just me and there is no hope, next day it's won't please someone give me a magic wand (but I won't ask!). If I seem ungrateful with any responses then that wasn't my intention, maybe it's my way, I always focus on negative and all I see is lots of people struggling and no-one coming out the other side. It feels like the blind leading the blind.
Further more most people seem to have a good reason through circumstance or substance abuse or dramas in their life -I'm just like this for no real reason. Pretty pathetic really.
My girlfriend does support me but it both helps me survive and yet stops me facing my issues and makes me feel not good enough and as if I'm holding her back. I know she doesn't feel that, but I feel like it MUST or it will eventually when she realises what she'll miss out on.
Cycles of mood are continuous but rarely hit a positive slant, some days I'm just ok and potter around and others I feel the strongest urge to give up. The only trigger I know doesn't help (but isn't crucial) is the weather but that's common with lots of people. A bad day will turn in to a bed day easily if it's grey! Lucky I live in UK
I've tried improvements in diet etc but I'm not exactly a bad eater anyway, exercise is fine but doesn't really change anything, just gives me something to do. Easily lose will to do it though. My socialising is obviously nonexistent and I try to encourage girlfriend to do her own thing with friends in that respect.
So in summary, nothings changed, I'm in a state of status quo, every plan I come up with I find a major flaw in, I strongly doubt there's a way out, I hate the way I look, sound and feel and feel I should protect people from their own blinkered love.
So, sorry and hope you have more success.

"Well your family and girlfriend would never get over it, from what I've read. Plus it can go wrong and be messy. It sounds like you thinking you are 'boring' is your take on things. You don't have to feel sad to be depressed, some feel nothing at all. I think it would be a shame to see you go. To me it sounds like you have plenty to be grateful for, a girlfriend, a family who loves you. Personally I recommend that you try yoga classes-I'm aware this sounds insane, but entertain the idea a second/bare with me. I suffer from OCD/depression/anxiety. Ever since I started doing yoga things got better for me-it helped me relax/exercise. You could spin this around and start thinking you have nothing to lose. As for the antidepressants I recommend you start exercising regularly-cardiovascular and weights. Similar effect, no side effects. Try setting yourself a regime Running in the morning, weights afternoon. Listen to music whilst doing so. You can beat this, trust me.

"I'm not deluded enough to think people wouldn't care if someone close to them wasn't there anymore. People aren't generally that heartless. However, it doesn't mean they wouldn't be better off. Like a child who is removed from an unfit parent; they'd cry and be upset and miss them but ultimately they're better off. We all get over loss - we don't as easily get over regret, disappointment and missed opportunities. Only I hold people back.
I agree, I have nothing to really complain about, I almost wish I did as then it'd explain it. I just can't cope with society; I can't even talk to people on the phone or worry about what a stranger thinks of me. I just don't know what to do; stubbornness, stupidity, anxiety stops me from doing things and every time I try to fight it I can only keep up the pretence for a while and then everything collapses. I just know I'm right - we seem scared to admit some people are just failures and not equipped. We could name loads of people in our lives we could say are useless or horrible etc, but the second their is an element of affection for them is we decide to lie to them and ourselves - ""they're just unlucky/ need help/ have hidden talents"" - I don't believe it.
I have, and if not struggling, do still do a fair bit of exercise. Cycling, jogging etc but fitness has never really helped. In my 20s particularly I was extremely fit but it didn't help. When I said way I look I meant more appearance than shape.
I do appreciate responses but worry there is no hope. Maybe I can't hear it even if there is....

Boring? Even if someone else did describe you in that way it's only their own subjective opinion. Ps I've found one of my hidden talents so I can't agree with you there. Inevitably you'll be good at something. I wasn't pointing out the good in your life to guilt trip you, I was hoping you could come up with a few more.

"I smiled at that last comment - my girlfriend says I'm too nice. It's a idea I struggle with (how can someone be too nice?) but she says people just take advantage or walk all over me. I'd bend over backwards to help a stranger even if it detrimented me which is possibly part and parcel of the worrying about what others think element. So whilst on here I may come across ungrateful I can assure you I'm not really - this is perhaps my selfish place. I've tried to be very thankful for all the responses on here, I just struggle to see any benefit in it.
You can't say you have a hidden talent and then not say what it is that's just mean...! Good for you though. Genuinely. However some people are just bang on average, I'm one of those. I'm not in some deluded spiral that makes me think I'm the worst at anything, or have a difficult hand or anything, I'm just realistic and know I, like many others, are just bang on average but if I do dip one way it's always the worse than average way. It's my head that beats me up for my limitations and stops me just fuctioning - it's hard to explain so I'll stop!
Trying to think of good things is difficult for me, I can't think of anything I can't put a negative slant on! Maybe I'm good at arguing... But if I look at widely accepted sections of my life it's not a good overall picture:
Family - fed up with me, disappointed and feel sorry for me on one hand. Have never really included me anyway (but maybe that's my withdrawal tendancies)
Love Life - good and yet that makes it bad! If I didn't care about her I'd be quite happy taking advantage but if you love someone you don't want to hurt them in any way, emotionally, financially, future etc. If you love them let them go as the saying goes...
Financially - was poor, sorted with job, would be cleared up in a few years (credit) but don't struggle day to day at all as girlfriend is very successful. So I'm just leaching...
Friends - if you can measure a person by their friends then I'm zero. I mean zero, not one person. My fault, there fault it, it doesn't really matter.
Health - other than this(!) ok really, standard weight, normal height, don't smoke, drink or do drugs. Eat reasonably healthily and do sport sporadically when it's either sunny and/or I have a spark of inspiration. Tried routines, lasted a week before a bad day threw it all off.
Career - down the pooper! Can't return to full time teaching, know I can't do that. To 'stuck up' for want of a better word to take a shop job knowing I trained to be a teacher. Also can't find another job that is term time only (to spend time with partner). I'd struggle in ANY job anyway. Too overqualified for most things that might suit purpose. Supply is possibility but that means new people and stuff every day - not my string point! Plus it means phone calls for availability and I can't talk on phone! Pathetic, whinging, excuse riddled crap eh? Not on benefits or anything as gf is on plentiful wage.
Looks - awful, have the face of a teenager who can't grow even a hint of a moustache never mind a beard which means I'm constantly asked for ID (or my parents if a knock at the door) despite being 34!!! People say you should be flattered but to me it feels like a kick in the face - maybe it's the bloke thing, it's like people telling you you're a child. I almost am a child... My facial skin is awful too, no creams or regimes suggested by the girlfriend work so I've just given up. Maybe I'm an expert at giving up!! To be fair, all things above have been tried for at least 6 months from drugs to therapy to face cream!
I do appreciate your help/advice. I still wonder if it's just character rather than depression. Maybe I'm just a cynical, boring, lonely, ugly loner. That's fine when it's just you, a killer when you feel you're holding others back from a 'proper' life.

"I search for topic on ""Tired of life"" because i feel the same as you.
Reading your issues, I feel that I am reading about myself, maybe I am worst than you.
Is it good or bad, happy or sad to know that I and you are not alone?
So you and I are normal, there are many people around us feeling this way.
Solution? I have none else i will not be here looking for an answer.
The only thing i know and can keep me going is
- Don't give up
- God have a plan
All I know is we are part of the future and the history of this world. Only God knows our purpose in this world.
Live life and do what we can, there are many things that we can't do and we can't change, there are still little things that we can do.
We are just a drop of water in the ocean but we still make up a part of the ocean.
Hope things get better for you and me.

"I really think you should try the medication route again. There are so many different types and combinations of antidepressants out there. I personally take 20mg of Paroxetine once a day and 50mg of Quetiapine before bed each night. It's only been a month but I really think it is helping me as well as chatting with people on this forum. I quit a good job of thirteen years last year because of anxiety, then spent the next six months sitting on the couch self-medicating on painkillers. Never to the extent that I was high, but just to feel normal. I had to kick my own arse into gear because I'm the sole carer of a special needs child and no-one else was there to step in to do the job. Everyday when I get up I still have to re-affirm my dreams and goals and why it so important that I get better. Almost like a daily mantra. One of my goals is to finish a novel I started before I got ill three years ago. But instead of just sitting down in front of the computer and writing, which really is not much of a motivation, I've joined an online writer's group and am in the process of doing up one of the spare rooms into a study. A place that belongs to me only where I can display all my favourite things (incuding my Star Wars collectibles) and where I can go to escape from the world. I guess I can say I do have genuine reasons for my anxiety and depression, including financial, health and the fact that my daughter is considered severely disabled (she has Phelan-McDermid Syndrome, one of only 500 in the world), but everyday I pick my daughter up from the special school she attends I am always reminded life could be far worse. You don't truly appeciate how lucky you are until you've walked though a special school full of wheelchair bound kiddies with feeding chubes in their little bellies. Since my daughter has attended that school at least three children have passed away because of the complications associated with their disabilities. My daughter may not be able to talk and I have to attend all her self-care needs even though she is nine years of age (and probably will for the rest of her life) but at least she is healthy and robust. Life feels so bloody hard sometimes, but I know I don't have a choice but to keep slogging along.

"Let me start by saying I feel for you, I really do. You have a GENUINE reason to feel like you do and should not feel bad or apologise for asking for help! You make me feel even more pathetic but that's my issue rather than yours!! Perspective makes me think even worse of myself as I know I'm lucky compared to lots - so why do I feel like this?
As regards the drug route, a lot of people have suggested this. However one major issue stops me and is not really ever talked about - I'm terrified of people/meetings etc! So I can't see a Doctor! When at my lowest I was being ferried around so had no choice and needed a Doctors note etc but now the thought of seeing a Doctor (or any body I know I have to talk to) terrifies me to the point I'd almost have a panic attack. So not sure what to do there really! Still not convinced on the drug thing anyway - it only made me slightly manic (obsessed with projects) and had no effect on my overall mood at all, well other than making the idea of 'going' seem even more rational.
So instead of me whinging on and on let me just make a few completely uneducated comments regarding your situation. You don't seem depressed so much as tired! I don't mean that in a dismissive way but you clearly have a lot on your plate and I think (if there is any) you need some support. I'd go as far as saying I doubt the drugs are halping you - they seem to be treating a symptom not a cause.
Did you have anxiety before all the pressures you're under? I think you'd feel a hell of a lot better quicker if you directed your energy to finding financial and/or respite support if there is any. You're probably doing too much and it's impacting on your health physically and emotionally. If there isn't any further help then, other than shaking your head at the hand you've been dealt, then you seem to have a good plan of action at the moment. If that plan could be super organised to include you (as in time for yourself etc) and maybe incorporate a job (if you so wished) you may find you were in control a bit more.
I'm not trying to sound dismissive at all I promise! You have a compelling reason to feel the way you do and I acknowledge I'm talking without all the facts. I just get the sense it's a lack of control on a very hectic/ emotional draining life that is you're primary concern. For example, if you won the lottery and could deal with all the bills and give the care to your daughter you wish do you think you'd feel infinitely better? You're depressed because of the situation I think so hopefully either you, or you and others, could plan a route that would help you considerably. I think there is a lot of hope for you to be VERY happy and enjoy your life with your daughter but you've just been struggling for years and it's worn you down. Asking for help (other than medicinal) is the right way to go.

"I am so sorry RSJG, it didn't mean to make you feel that way. Yeh, I know a lot of my depression is situational and a do have a plan of action, including going back to university to study Occcupational Therapy so I can get my dream job working with special needs children.
Your girlfriend obviously doesn't think you are pathetic otherwise she wouldn't be with you. Leaving her because you believe you are a burden would just devastate her and break her heart so please don't follow that path. You sound like you are a very intelligent guy and would have no problems getting another job. I guess it is just working out what you want to do.
Also, there doesn't have to be a reason to suffer from depression. A lot of people have a genetic dispostion for depression. My Dad, sister and brother all have bipolar. Two of my Uncles are alcoholics (depression related) and I have a cousin who committed suicide in his teens... I guess it is how we treat/control our depression that matters.
On a last note, what is so wrong about being ordinary? 99 per cent of the population is made up of ordinary people just going about their lives. It is the media that skews this perception.

"Please don't be sorry - very aware that's my issue not yours!
You sound like you have a very clear plan, you almost sound excited! I'm sure you are, but if you're not do, but make that your focus and you may feel the clouds lift quite a lot! I envy that purpose, or goal or action plan - I can't think of any!
I think my girlfriend might stay with someone she felt sorry for, like a responsibility for so to speak. I think she WOULD be sad if I 'left' but she'd be happy again a lot sooner than having to live with me! It's quite analytical, I recognise that, but to me I'd rather her be sad for a year with 'loss' rather than sad for 20 years with me! It's weighing up value, short term pain for long term gain... As for a job, my head stops me, I feel I can do most jobs but only temporarily as my head messes me up, messes my professional relationships up and I just can't see how I can hold down a job - it's hard to explain, but being sociable (like you have to be at work) is almost physically draining and eventually my energy runs out and I drop all the balls I'm juggling.
You may be right about reason for depression but the genetic one concerns me most - that means I'll never be 'fixed'... I'd rather just give up now.
Ordinary to me is depressing. Ordinary is forgetable, ordinary is boring, ordinary doesn't 'exist'. To give you a glimpse of my thinking; the popular kids in school were 'exceptional', but even the bullied kids had something about them. When you're average, you're invisible. You can take the (friendly) mick out of someone who's bad at something, you can admire the talent of someone who's great at something, but when someone is average it's just a shrug, no story, move on. I'm genuinely the most forgettable man in the world! I'm one of a large group of siblings, I'm one forgotten in family dos, I was one forgotten at school (old teacher remembered all siblings during catch up chat to parents bar me) I'm one forgotten at work - I really am a waste of space!
The media's main fault is trying to make people believe that happy endings exist, that we all have a hidden talent and if you want something enough then it magically comes true. Sorry, my view is very much it doesn't! It doesn't 'all work out in the end' and we're just fed this fantasy world that depresses us when the reality slaps us in the face!
Sorry - trying so hard not to just 'release' on here....

"Facts are facts ... Don't you realise that it is your depression that is creating this skewed peception of yourself? It is almost like body dysmorphia, instead it not just your body but it is all encompassing, everything that you are. Sorry this just reminds me of an argument I had with a very religious co-worker a few years ago. He saw no value in my severely disabled daughters life as she would never be a productive member of society. My daughter has value to me, she saved me from my depression and has made me a better person. EVERYONE HAS VALUE. Please see this and please try to get some help. Also maybe you should start volunteering while you are considering what to do career wise. You will realise very quickly how much you are truly appreciated when you are handing out hot meals to homeless people in the cold of winter.

"Please do not get me wrong, I do not believe any one characteristic makes someone of no value, further more I think it'd be impossible not to be of SOME value, it's just to what weighting you give a value when compared to all the problems it may cause. For example, alcohol gives you a small boost but, when abused, can cause significant problems. For those with a problem, it may be better to just give up the alcohol.
I too have multiple issues with religion (that's a real rant!) but I don't think anyone has the right to judge another. I would never judge anyone else as worthless, but I know myself and can judge myself. I stand by that judgement based on what I know, what I do, what I think and the proof I have. A person suffering from anorexia will ignore the scales reading too low a weight, I suffer from no dilusions. Everything points to me being everything I think I am.
You sound like a much better person than me, you maintain strength in difficulty and have the fight in you to counter injustice. I can barely face people so volunteering is out of the question, whether that is lazy or cowardly, I simply can't pretend to be 'normal' any more and public is so much energy.
I am a faceless person on here. The reality of me is much worse.

"I'm not even sure I have depression, I think this may just be 'me'.
I have always been pretty useless socially, but have had a normal upbringing, no horrible experiences, have gone through education fine and even got jobs but I've never enjoyed life, never really cared and normally feel like I'm not really worth anything and, inevitably enventually, will become a burden.
I'm not going to be dramatic and say I'm going to end it, it sounds so pathetic (no offence intended to anyone) but I have thoughts of 'going' or even dreams that I could die 'blamelessly' thorugh accident or illness. Selfish I know.
I have a cycle. Get job, put on confident easy going persona, get physically tired from doing that, lose energy to maintain job, focus on negative, leave job in some form (fired/quit). Friends are much the same, play easy going fun, can't keep it up, lose or push them away. Relationships, get attracted to ones who need help, help them in anyway I can, get to a point where I feel I am no more use so should go as they'd be ultimately better off.
So, currently I've quit my job as a teacher, couldn't take it - always something to improve and with my way of thinking that just sounds like constantly someone telling you you're useless (and it backing up your own thoughts anyway) but even though I liked aspects of my job I don't think I had a passion like I see in others. I felt I'd let everyone down so disappeared, my partner/ parents got me through immediate days after my sudden departure from work and saw Doc who was nice enough - put me on medication which seemed to do very little - even after a few months. In fact it only had negative side effects so about three weeks ago I stopped taking them completely. I also started seeing a CBT person about three/four session ago but this feels like it's doing nothing at all either, we talk, I'm honest as I can be but there is some element of being 'public' and putting on that face/ jokey responses.
I dip between a wish to not be around that is forever there and seems to be backed up with wholly logical reasons that people genuinely struggle to refute to absolutely crashing panic attacks/ given up when my 'theories' are proved.
I know this sounds odd, but I don't even have the will to get 'better', largely because I don't think I can. I am just 'me'. I am negative, boring and even if it is all just selffullfillng profecies - it's still me who has done that. I'm not blaming life, or others or anything else.
A lot of the posts I read on here seem to have good reason; PTS, loss, finances etc - does anyone have no 'good' reason?
I just feel I'm never going to be happy, I am soon to be much a burden on those around me (my gf) and that, in the long run, it'd be better for all if I just went. I know my family and gf love me - but time heals, life would get better and people move on. In the long run I'm sure it wouldn't effect my family and 100% sure my gf would be better off.
Not sure if there is an answer for this, just writing. I'm not angry, I'm not hurt, I'm not even sad as such, I'm just tired...

"Hi rsjg - reading your reply and other's responses is quite overwhelming... Its clear that you're reconnecting with people on this forum after 8 months away, and that to me is a sign that something has shifted, that you're feeling different and something has changed, even if its only a little change. In your writing, you often demonstrate your compassion, and its clear you do care about the way people feel about themselves and how they approach their lives.
I really like this 'holding back' metaphor as well - it makes me imagine your girlfriend just raring to go and 'get' her life, but you behind her holding her back! Or something quiescent in you that you're holding back. Or a supportive gesture - holding/rubbing someone's back....
Oh, my legs are stiff and neck bent, I've been on the computer too long - just going to stretch out....

"I care a lot about most people, more than is healthy perhaps. I take on others problems if I can and feel more useful if I'm helping someone else. I'm often accused of making people's decisions for them regarding me though, although I don't see that as an issue if I'm protecting them. For example I say I should leave gf to protect her, she and family say it's her decision to give up on me not mine. I still struggle a lot with that way of thinking. I feel you should protect people, even from themselves sometimes.
A reply after 8 months due to some shift.... bit more mundane I'm afraid, someone replied after a long time, put effort in to their thread and I had an email telling me so I felt it was polite to respond! Sorry!
Is 'holding back' a strange metaphor?! :D But yeah, maybe that's what it is - in fact it'd be easier to escape as I have no upper body strength at all! But it's meant more in the way that if I struggle through on the low level I am my girlfriend will put up with it and not have the marrigate, house, holidays, and have to basically look after me (phone calls, sorting anything that invloves others, avoiding social events to look after me) where as if I went, she'd be sad for a while, perhaps never even forget, but move on and get a 'proper' boyfriend and get all that stuff. She didn't sign up for this - she met the fake easy-going confident full time teacher with prospects...!
Is there such thing as too much time on a computer?! I didn't realise! I filled in a survey the other day - it said how long do you spend on the interent a day. I was strugling to find the 'all day' option!

"At first I got so many similarities to the ones you've described (experienced or imagined due to age) that I didn't even wanted to bother of adding anything since I feel the same as you and many people that I've seen responding,eventually no hope could be ananswer for accepting this constant feeling.But after seeing this reply I even made an account to ask,or even suggest ,if love could offer support for reason in life since good points where made and didn't see something close.Finding a girlfriend is great,but not in being fake,therefore I feel that true love could be something helpfull if it would be at a levell she loves you as beeing a burden,but I may bee romanticly over fantasising the whole perception you may have uppon this and then your dilemma is perfectly understandable for me,but without other answer as a solution. I say this in the best possible manner as you are another great person which can have a chance even for herself,altough we want to help others rather that ourselves.And for staying on the internet is to long after you begin sleeping.

"Hey rsjg, I sympathise and relate to a lot of the things you have said, especially about being invisible and distinctly average, I too have always been ""good"" at things to a certain extent but never been any competition to the real pros - even my University degree, job - never stand out workwise or socially, forgettable if anything.
But, what you need to stop thinking is that you have to be the best in the eyes of the rest of the world - who cares? Do whatever you want and not because you are the best at it, but because it's enjoyable. Jobs, don't necessarily have to be heavily people-based, a friend of mine is a website designer, he earns a hell of a lot of money but, spends most of his work-life alone, working from briefs. I currently work in the media industry and jump on cameras for 8 hours out of a 10 hour shift simply because it means I don't have to speak to anyone or be around anyone.
Maybe there isn't anything you massively excel in but, I'm sure there's something you enjoy doing, or being somewhere. Sitting in a field, in the middle of nowhere with my dog next to me is something I enjoy for example.
The loss of a loved one - yes, time is a great healer, for most usually, but not everyone and not always. Grief works in dark ways and can lead to massive self destruction, bad decisions and depression. Have a little more faith in your girlfriend, the most frustrating thing in the world is being told ""you'd be better off in the long run without me.""
Maybe you should give meds a go and use it to ease the anxiety and go out and do something that scares you - you're not afraid of death? Great - go bungee jumping, sky dive, jump off the top of the Stratosphere in Vegas. Be strong, do something different, go away with your girlfriend, somewhere new, somewhere different, somewhere quiet.
You're never going to think any differently to the way you do unless you make some massive changes in your life and only you can do that! :-)

"It's strange talking on the internet as you answer one comment but then someone else adds an extension question, but all of it is stuff you've thought before. Does that make sense?! Another words, whilst I offer my opinion on a particular though process it doesn't mean I've not actually gone far beyond that in my own thinking.
So to answer your very well thoughout view, it is all stuff I have thought of before and almost counted out! I'm just a whiner obviously
If I did what I want I'd be sportsman, but then we have to be realistic and say that isn't going to bring in any wage! Besides, I also know I struggle in team situations in reality as I struggle with the bravado that is especially prevalent in male sports. So what else do I enjoy, genuinely, nothing. But even I recognise that might be an extension of my apathy. Teaching is fun, I love working with kids... but the other teachers, parents, Ofsted, paperwork, and most constant judgement of any career makes it impossible. On a side note, if you have any issues with self confidence, teaching is NOT the way to go! I've never known a career in which you're so reguarly scutinised and there's always something you could have done better - and if you're of a fragile nature you naturally only focus on that.
No jobs don't have to be people based, I too have worked in media as a journalist (although that is people based!) but can't think of anything I'd enjoy or, more pertinently, be able to do - skill, time or wage wise! Setting up a cattery would be nice, but need money for that. Being an architect always appealed by I have neither the time (course duration) or the skills to do it!
I'm not sure if this is normal or not; I struggle with people but also struggle alone. It's not like once I have escaped people I feel relaxed. Maybe I'm in a sydrome called 'grass is always greener'! When left alone I am even more self destructive in my thoughts - thinking time is not good time.
I do appreciate you saying 'maybe there isn't anything you massively excel in' - it's those kind of statements that make me think people are writing realistically rather than using a softly softly approach. It's not like negatives are the only reality but I can only begin to believe a statement if people acknowledge the bad. People saying ""I'm sure you're good at x"" just makes me turn off, someone saying ""Ok, you're crap at that BUT try...."" is much more realistic. Unfortunately I haven't found the good thing!
I know that 'you'd be better off' is an extremely frustrating statement. The question is, do you reveal what you're thinking or keep it to yourself? I always say 'be careful what you ask or you might not like the answer', but if I'm being asked to open up and not bottle feelings then where is the line on what is acceptable to share and what isn't? I can't help very strongly feeling that.
I do think time heals and it seems logical to reduce any pain to it's minimum; a year or so after I'm gone or a lifetime of regrets, missed opportunities and struggles with me around. I can't do the whole marriage, kids thing. I am next to useless when it comes to mortgages and luxuries. We all start with dreams of being rich and famous and having everything we want, we then give up certain dreams as childhood subsides and reality kicks in, as we get older we give up more and more dreams as we can't achieve them. But once you've given up every dream, don't you just fade away? A very old person knows they will not travel the world again, they know they can not look like a 30 year old movie star, their wish may be to see a grandchild go to university or even simply to reach 100. But once you've done everything you can do, or know you will ever do, then, to me, it feels like it's time to go.
I tried the meds, ok only once, but it didn't work. I can't face going back to the doctors again and having to talk about all this. It feel so pathetic talking to a grown man about my piddly stupid head. There's people going in there with proper problems, or at least fixable ones!
Am I afraid of death? Not really, the thought of it is very much in my head. And I mean the actual thought, not the before or the after, the thought of that last breath then nothing. I don't think greatly of the drama of after a death (like 'oh people will miss me etc etc) I just am transfixed on the thought of that very last spark of the brain. It will come one day. Whilst I'm very careful not to talk about suicide on here ('gone' or 'left' being much friendlier terms) I know I'd never make me passing traumatic for train divers, dog walkers or unsuspecting family members.
Bungee-jumping, skydiving or Vegas all sound great. But that's where the reality sets in, how exactly am I paying for this?! If there was one thing that I think would have the greatest impact on my mental health it'd be winning the lottery - I could then distract myself with things, or feel like I was providing for my family. I'd still have those demons, I'd still avoid people, I'd still have no friends etc, but instead of stewing I'd be being kept busy on a beach in Hawaii! Money doesn't solve everything, but it makes the low points easier to deal with as you can more readily escape. I do love travel that being said, and when ever I can afford it I do.
I'm never going to feel differently to the way I do... that's as far as I'm willing to agree with your last statement! I've actually tried the big changes, I've tried doing the things that scare me or out of my comfort zone. I went to University alone, along way away from family, I travelled Europe camping for a summer, I took on jobs I didn't think I could do, I moved to new areas with no contacts. I think I've done everything I'm 'supposed' to improve myself and my thinking. But none of it worked, all of is (possibly self-inflicted) failed, I always reverted to 'type'.
I appreciate everyone on here giving their time to convince me otherwise. I have never doubted there are very nice people in this world, just as there are horrible ones. I do believe the horrible ones get a 'better' life but that's a different conversation. But I'm beginning to find that me answering these views is just making me more sure I'm right - I'm a hopeless case.
Whether it's depression, anxiety, personality, whining, my fault, other's fault, luck or time it now kind of strikes me as irrelevant. I'm at this destination, there are no more stops.

"You don't have to be a sportsman in terms of career, just do it on the side, something to keep the week interesting. No offence intended, but if you are not working, socialising, going out or doing anything then, why wouldn't you feel down, hopeless and depressed? You'd have to be a very special type of person not to be!
I understand your fear of doctors, genuinely :P but, in my totally non-professional view, it sounds like your anxiety is what's gripped you and thrown you into the depressive state: none of your symptoms/views or opinions are new, none of them are unique in the grand scheme of things, there are thousands, ney - millions with the same view of life, there's just far fewer on these specific forums to connect and compare with.
Back in regards to your girlfriend, you say you love her - completely believe this, you say you think she is better off without you and that she would be ok etc. - you wrote this thread eight months ago...why stay with her? Why not break it off if everything has been finalised in your head? If you truly have no future with this girl wouldn't you end the relationship rather than string it a long?
The final comment I will make is that to me, if you went and saw the GP - maybe bring a long your girlfriend or somebody who makes you feel a bit more at ease, don't see a male GP, personally I never do. My own GP told me that female doctors are usually a lot more compassionate, regardless. Sort out your anxiety, that's the main thing that's holding you back, yes a drug that may work wonders for one person may not make a difference to you and no, they are not a magic fix and won't make everything better in a few weeks - it's trial and error and it takes a very long time. You say your opinion is accurate but everything you have tried that may have helped you out in the long run, you gave up on before it could take effect.
I wouldn't focus too much on the whole ""I don't have genuine reason to be depressed"" because no matter what the reason, there will always be somebody worse off than you. A lot of people get depressed for no apparent reason, it's a very unfortunate but very real part of life.
Again, I'm no professional and my opinion in reality means nothing, I'm just a stranger trying to give you a kick

"Kick away!
Fair enough, I don't do much at the moment. I occasionally do a little bit of exercising (jogging/cycling) but a grey cloud, real or metaphorical, quickly kills any energy I have! I don't think it's the lack of doing anything that causes this however, I'm still 'better' than when I was at work/ socialising - but then if this is the best it gets... well.
I have visitied the Doctor, and for the record he was really nice. Very supportive in fact. But it didn't change the fact I felt stupid and as if I was wasting his, and others, time. I remember being really worked up about the fact our appointment slot was overunning because I felt like I was holiding up other people. But I did that because my girlfriend was with me at all times (and forced me!) and because I needed to get a Doctors note for work. Now I no longer work, I no longer need to waste people's time. But you're right, I'm an expert in giving up!
The girlfriend question comment is a difficult one and the one I battle every day more than anything else. If I leave her there is nowhere to go, that really is it. I mean that in the practical sense here, house etc but also it means that really is the end. I stay through her appeals and for maybe that ounce of hope that she, and others, are right that it'll pass. Although I've always been like this. I'm not staying with her for ease, or to string her along, but leaving her really is a final decision - I have no belief there is something better than her. Probably makes no sense. The 1% hope keeps me alive, therefore the 1% keeps me here. If I lose the here, I have absolutely zero interest in the alive.
I really do appreciate your replies, a constructive kick is better than a compassionate hug for me. But I can't find that kick that I can't talk my way around or explain away. I hate my head! I have actually tried everything I'm supposed to, maybe not for long enough, but I've seen zero difference. Leaving work calmed me down and made me able to uncurl from a ball but does that mean I can never return to a job? That then creates different problems emotionally and financially.
I saw the CBT guy but, nice as he was, he tried a religious route with me (never going to work) and I put on my fake chatty character for the hour, even if I was tired afterwards. It didn't do anything. Even if I try to get refered again by the Doctor, I'd actually be scared that I'd be seeing him again, or be seen to have asked not for him - and although I'm fairly sure he wouldn't care, it genuinely freaks me out! How messed up is that?!
I'm actually ok, if I prepare well, for an hour or so around people - I can seem easy going and chatty, any longer than that and it gets difficult. If I can't prepare, i.e. I know there will be questions I'm not expecting or it's someone I feel who will judge me e.g. a car mechanic as a 'guy' then I can't do it. How silly is this - I still get uneasy surrounded by teenage girls! I'm not in the remotest bit interested in them obviously, but just the feeling of inadequacy/ that I'm a loser makes me feel 'weird'. Same with family, there is a duration before it gets too personal; I can feel myself being overly happy and lively around them as if it's all pouring out on first meeting them but that there is a finite amount and then my energy drops and I disappear.
Grrr.... I'm whining again. Shoot me.

"I, and this thread, are probably not the best avenue to seek answers. It's very much a 'give up' thread the way it's going!
Start your own thread. Tell your story if you want, writing it down can help clarify what areas of your life make you feel the way you do. You may have a reason when you just keep writing.
I'm not going to give you the easy answer and say ""I'm sure you're amazing"" as I don't know you and that's just not realistic. I know nothing about you.
However, on these boards are a lot of clever, kind, insightful people so they would be much better placed to help you than me. I don't think us mutually agreeing how tiring life is will help either of us.

"Typical responces in themselves are not a bad thing, but perhaps too generic for most people. However, with limited information they are the only thing that can be given to you.
I don't feel you can give up until you've tried. So you'll need to talk to someone on here, close to you, a doctor or a therapist or someone. You need to gve them a lot of information.
If you've done all that and still feel like giving up then I fully sympathise. Just try to avoid giving one line sentences as that is not sharing, that is a call for help and you'd be much better seeking moe immediate attention like the Samaritans etc (unless you're scared of phone calls like me!)
I do symathise, but you need to share and you need to try first.

"Hey--I made an account just to reply to this. Granted, it was using a fake email, but eh. I just wanted to say that I understand how you feel. I really, really understand, and I've searched all over the web for everything about depression, social anxiety, suicidal tendencies, and other topics along a similar vein.
So I think I have a bit of knowledge. :P
First of all, I just want to say that yes, you do have depression. I'm pretty sure you've confirmed that with yourself by now, but the symptom you seem to mostly express of depression is apathy. You're apathetic--you don't care, and sometimes, it scares you and confuses you and frustrates you as to why you don't care. Why don't you care? How does it make sense to just not care about life, whenever everyone around you seems to always care?
Or maybe I have it totally wrong, and that's not what you think, but I'll answer those questions to the best of my abilities anyway. Apathy is part of depression, and depression can be caused by many things. I for one know it is genetic--my dad had it, my paternal grandmother had it, and I don't know farther back than that but I'm fairly certain it's because of that. So it could be that you're the same and your depression is genetic, which in that case you should ask family members about it, or that it's caused by your lack of satisfaction with what you have and what you are doing. You don't feel fulfilled, and you don't feel passionate about anything.
You should find something, then. I know that sounds ridiculous, and hard, and ridiculously hard. Try music, sketching, singing, swimming, writing, ice-skating, dancing, whatever--as long as it's enjoyable, it's helpful. It's just a hobby. It's not for you to feel bad about yourself that you can't do any of those or you suck at those because who the hell cares? It's just something you like to do. As long as you can find something like that, then it's one step out of the deep dark pit you've dug yourself into.
Another thing is to talk to people. Your girlfriend, for instance, could be one person to start with, or maybe you have a really close friend you would prefer talking to. Whoever you think you can trust the most, who you think will listen the most, believe you the most, talk to them. Don't feel like you're being a burden on them because seriously, they want to help someone they love. They love you, goddamn it, and don't forget that.
Since my depression is genetic, it's been following me around for a while. It's always hung around me, but in the past couple of months it hit me again and I was struggling for the longest time, trying to fight it off and trying to keep up a happy disposition around friends at school but always in the end feeling terrible and useless. And finally I decided I had to talk to someone. I talked to my sister. It was over the course of several talking sessions with her that I learned something: she really, truly cared. I mean--she really, really did. It wasn't that she hugged me and I cried in front of her and it was some disgustingly sweet sh*t, but it was that she listened and when I implied that yeah, lately, I've had suicidal thoughts...
Well, she said, ""If you actually, like, took your life, I don't know--I would feel really terrible. Like, I would be really sad. I might commit suicide, too.""
And she is not a suicidal person in any aspect. It just told me that she would be deeply affected by my death and she wanted me around; she thought I was interesting and one of her closest companions and she still does, of course.
Hm, I think I'm getting off-topic. You may or may not have someone like that in your life, but you don't know unless you talk to them. Even if you don't, it's out there--you talked to them, and connected with other human beings, and as humans, we crave human contact--even the most reclusive of us. I know I sometimes just need to be alone, but I still need my ""fix"" of social interaction to feel not-lonely.
Now, you mentioned feeling anxious about talking to your doctor about getting more meds. Social anxiety right there. You can search up the definition if you'd like to find several different definitions and examples and stuff that you could relate to and find more information about. However, it's basically that you overanalyze social situations you're in and criticize yourself about your own reactions and actions before, during, and after a certain social interaction, and everything that you did was oh-so-stupid. You're upset about it, of course. You're embarrassed.
The thing is, however, is that you're likely not going to see them again. You think it's embarrassing to tell them about your depression, but keep in mind that there's plenty of people like us out there and plenty of people have gone to doctors to get meds for their depression. Your doctor may have seen PLENTY of people who have depression. It's a serious problem that needs treatment--don't imagine that just because it's not a physical illness or injury that it's not as important. It IS important.
And if you think you embarrass yourself while visiting the doctor, so what? You talk to them, make a fool out of yourself, but you get your medication. And...you think about it afterwards, and realize, hey, nothing actually happened to you. You're still fine after that one interaction. They're not going to spend all day thinking about you and your apparent making-a-fool-out-of-yourself, so you don't need to either. What could help, I'm not sure, is think about him/her and not yourself. Observe them, and notice any flaws about them, and feel like you're in power of the situation because you're better than them.
Ha, that's not really great advice. :P I'm not sure I'm describing it right, but I hope you get the gist of what I'm saying.
I hope you can figure your life out--I have finally started for myself, and it feels nice to talk about it. Just talk. Communication is key. Feel free to reply and mention anything else you may have problems with/questions about and maybe I can discuss them/answer them...?

"I love the way you write! It sounds really verbal! Very nice of you to sign up to reply. How weird is this though; I didn't think I had paranoia but you almost sound like my little sister! I know you're not, but in my head I'm beginning to wonder whether I should write on here!
I probably do have depression, I acknowledge that. I think my personality might not help but I agree, depression is likely. I have social anxiety, I over think far too much, I have mild symptoms of OCD, I have some body issues, I hide my trichotillomania well being male (face) and I'm somewhat of a perfectionist or idealist - if I could have done it better then it was crap.
Genetically speaking there doesn't seem to be any history of it in my family. Because of the way my last job blew up, my parents became more aware of the situation. That's not to say they were completely blind to it, but it became more of a discussion. My parents have both had depression due to work but were fine before and after the event that caused it (tribunals etc) but they don't really understand the 'lack of reason' side of it. I shared with them for a while, on both ups and downs, but got the impression it was upsetting them so have largely stopped talking about it. I never mentioned suicide to them. Again, due to the situation my older sister became aware and she too pressed a little but there is a limit you want to talk about things when all it does is upset people and they can't help you anyway. I have not talked about it with other family members. I'm already known as the depressing one, so I try to sound super happy when I'm around family now. I was told that the reason I'm, at least subconciously, left out in family gatherings is because I'm quiet/ serious/ boring (actual terms!). I'm aware they'd care if I wasn't here - most people are genetically programmed to protect their kin, but my absence would make no difference really. I now spend Xmas away from family, I'm fairly sure they're happier for it! I hate being a chore. I love your statement about it being 'disgusting sweet s*t' - that's so very much my style, even in the depths it's very much black humour, sarcasm etc - struggle with sweet stuff!
Outside my family there is just my girlfriend. That sounds extreme, but it's really not. I don't have a single other friend, that is equally my fault. But I talk to no one from University days, no ex colleagues etc. I know no-one else. Partially I like it that way, it's easy and I don't feel like a burden, on the other hand I feel like some of them could have fought to 'look after me' - they all gave up very easily. I know that's not fair. You shouldn't test your friends. But on the other hand, if I really cared for someone and knew they were struggling emotionally, I'd put in a little more effort. I wasn't ever mean or snappy with them, I just kind of disappeared. But it's not their job to understand mental issues, they have their own busy lives with their own problems.
So I sometimes speak to my girlfriend, less so these days though. When it all hit the fan I had no choice but to share everything with her, not that it was brand new information of anything - I've been with her for a long time. But maybe the intensity of the feelings was new, of the fact they were always there. But again, there's very little she can do so why depress her. I don't want to see her cry because of me. So I've largely stopped talking about things, in a way that might give her the impression I'm improving. Occasionally stuff slips out, or I sarcastically mention 'leaving' but I cover it well now. I still tell her to find someone else, I cover it in a light/jokey way but, although I'm not stupid and I know she sees though it, it is kind of an acceptable level of sharing.
You're right about social anxiety too. That I fully recognise. I care way more than I should, or want to, about others thoughts. Doesn't stop it though. I do analyse everything I've said and done before and after events but I can't forget it - really stupid example; I still remember saying something that was taken the mick out of at school, probably really mildly, and that was about twenty five years ago! How the hell can I get over this when I still stew over stuff I said when I was 9?!
Despite seeing every flaw in myself I don't take criticism well, not in a grumpy way but in a defeatest way. If I'm told a million things are good but 'this' needs improving then it was an awful experience. I know that is both ridiculous and common but want it stop effecting me so much. In complete contrast I am very patient and forgiving of others, I'll always see the other side of the argument and I'll happily give people as much time as they need. I'm the epitomy of 'do as I say, not as I do!'. I know where I'm going wrong, I know my thought processes are messed up, but I just don't know how to fix them. I can't think of many situations where I've felt 'better' than anyone else - the closest I get it wondering why horrible people in this world are more likely to succeed; stupidity is rewarded (TOWIE type), rudeness is applauded (Cowell), stabbing people in the back is relabled 'ambition', and generous people get walked on and criminals win the lottery!
I'm really happy you've started to figure your life out. You sound very intelligent and in control. You also mentioned being in school so I suspect you are quite young; for you to have such a good grip on your feelings and recognise triggers and mental health issues is quite impressive. Is it an avenue you have interest in? I'm genuinely happy you have got such a grip on it early, understanding it early may help you in the long run - I don't know, but I suspect the longer this is left the harder it is to undo the 'learning to hate yourself' that is embedded in to you. Much like whe I used to teach, the longer you left a mistake/misconception with a child the harder it was to 'unteach' it - so I just have 34 years to unteach myself!
And you're definitely not my little sister are you?!

"I'm not even sure I have depression, I think this may just be 'me'.
I have always been pretty useless socially, but have had a normal upbringing, no horrible experiences, have gone through education fine and even got jobs but I've never enjoyed life, never really cared and normally feel like I'm not really worth anything and, inevitably enventually, will become a burden.
I'm not going to be dramatic and say I'm going to end it, it sounds so pathetic (no offence intended to anyone) but I have thoughts of 'going' or even dreams that I could die 'blamelessly' thorugh accident or illness. Selfish I know.
I have a cycle. Get job, put on confident easy going persona, get physically tired from doing that, lose energy to maintain job, focus on negative, leave job in some form (fired/quit). Friends are much the same, play easy going fun, can't keep it up, lose or push them away. Relationships, get attracted to ones who need help, help them in anyway I can, get to a point where I feel I am no more use so should go as they'd be ultimately better off.
So, currently I've quit my job as a teacher, couldn't take it - always something to improve and with my way of thinking that just sounds like constantly someone telling you you're useless (and it backing up your own thoughts anyway) but even though I liked aspects of my job I don't think I had a passion like I see in others. I felt I'd let everyone down so disappeared, my partner/ parents got me through immediate days after my sudden departure from work and saw Doc who was nice enough - put me on medication which seemed to do very little - even after a few months. In fact it only had negative side effects so about three weeks ago I stopped taking them completely. I also started seeing a CBT person about three/four session ago but this feels like it's doing nothing at all either, we talk, I'm honest as I can be but there is some element of being 'public' and putting on that face/ jokey responses.
I dip between a wish to not be around that is forever there and seems to be backed up with wholly logical reasons that people genuinely struggle to refute to absolutely crashing panic attacks/ given up when my 'theories' are proved.
I know this sounds odd, but I don't even have the will to get 'better', largely because I don't think I can. I am just 'me'. I am negative, boring and even if it is all just selffullfillng profecies - it's still me who has done that. I'm not blaming life, or others or anything else.
A lot of the posts I read on here seem to have good reason; PTS, loss, finances etc - does anyone have no 'good' reason?
I just feel I'm never going to be happy, I am soon to be much a burden on those around me (my gf) and that, in the long run, it'd be better for all if I just went. I know my family and gf love me - but time heals, life would get better and people move on. In the long run I'm sure it wouldn't effect my family and 100% sure my gf would be better off.
Not sure if there is an answer for this, just writing. I'm not angry, I'm not hurt, I'm not even sad as such, I'm just tired...

"I mean this with the greatest respect, but would you not be better finding support in your native language?
You sound like you have identified the issues that are causing your depression and sound like you may be able to talk through your fears and problems but I'm concerned you may struggle to clearly express yourself if you're speaking in a foreign language.
Don't get me wrong, you're English is far better than my non-existant Russian! I just think you need to be able to talk freely and that could be hard if English is not your first language.

"So you're an Indian person living in Russia speaking English... That's bloomin impressive! But I still maintain you might find it tricky to express yourself in a personal way in a language other than your home one.
However, don't let me discourage you if you feel it is benefitting you in anyway. You sound slightly lonely but I imagine that is largely due to your personal circumstances and possibly a short term thing while you sort your education in medicine. Keep that goal in mind and the time will fly. Once you've qualified you will probably have a lot more choices and can then choose where to be. If you're going to these lengths to follow your profession then you clearly enjoy it so that's another thing that is good.
I'm sure you could find like minded people local to you if you looked. There are very few 'unique' people in this world that you wouldn't have something in common with. But I'm not sure if you've fully explained what's wrong, what's making you unhappy.
Imagine dragons are very good, Mark Wahlberg not so much

"Unfortunately there is very little I, or any other stranger, could say that would automatically give you hope. Not if you want a genuine answer rather than an empty sentiment of 'you're amazing!'.
What I would say is you need to look at any positives if you can find them, you need to ask a friend, family member if they have any. You need to think is there any of these things you can change if you don't like them? If you conclude you are hopeless then you need to speak to a Doctor and see if there is anything they can advise.
Without details it's impossible to give you hope. I doubt anyone can give you a magic answer. But if you say x is the issue then maybe you can plan your way through it, not to solve it but to have hope.
Hope is hard.

"Thank you So much for the reply rsjg. Here it goes.. My problem is something too irrigative even myself. I am unmarried and i am 26 years old. I was in relationship with a guy more than 5 years.. We broke up many times and compromised too many times. It’s all just bcz I have bad habit of not hurting anyone. Whatever he does I used to excuse him. However he was kinda guy with negative/inferiority complex. He always used to think that I ll cheat him even though I did lot many sacrifices for him and waited for 5 years. He always used to imagine that I have other affairs even if I say 100 times dont think negative. His words tortured me like hell. I Started to doubt myself by listening same kinda blamings from him every time. Finally decided to come out from that relationship. I said OK to my parents for their process of searching guys for me. But my mind set is not allowing me to say OK to any of the guys they show. I get too many questions and I find too many faults in everyone. Even sometimes I feel like why do I get marry and spoil that guy's life? Sometimes I feel I dont want marriage and run away from all. Whole village started to talk wrong about me. I do even started to doubt myself. Am I mental?
I dont even mingle too much with freinds these days. There is a reason for that. I dont mingle too much with female friends, coz I feel that girls always have jealous and always two girls cant be friends for so long coz possessiveness is the big chalenge in girls. And I have the real experience with my so called female friends. I am fine to mingle with guys from my childhood. But whichever guy becomes my friend, I treat him as my Good friend. But for them/him always friendship with girl-means a different thing. I dont understand why all guys sexually attract towards me even if i dont expect it from them. I doubt myself that do I look like prostitute? I dont think so... But If I intrupt and ask about marriage with the same guy he of- course rejects me. Whats wrong with me. Why the whole world is like this? I feel tortured when I think about this kinda behavior from my so called friends. So I stopped to talking any friends.. Neither girls.. nor guys... Bcs of all these confusions I am not even satisfied with my professional life. Feeling too much stressed. I started to stay alone now. But staying alone suppressed me completely. I feel like I lost meaning for life. I dont understand why am I alive. Why should we lead life just to earn. why should we lead the life to struggle like this. If someone suggests me to go enjoy the life by partying or travelling, then I feel like why do we need to enjoy life when there is no use to anyone? Just to lead the life I need to live? There must be a reason or meaning for our life, else living like hopeless is of no use. I hate myself. I feel like I am burden for my parents. I cant even die when they are alive. I cant hurt them. I cant even live the life like this. Feeling frustrated on my own behavior.
I know I will have to consult a psychiatrist for counseling. But am I really a patient? what is my fault in this? Society influenced my mind like this. It is not my by birth character. My life is full of questions. Full of dilemmas.

"Please forgive me if any of this is presumptious, but I have to reply on a 'feeling' when I am reading strangers' messages and so if any of what I've assumed is incorrect please tell me.
I am 34 and unmarried but I get the feeling this is a cultural issue for you? You say you feel you need to be married, yet I know no-one who married before 30 and a majority of those were much later. Do you WANT to be married? There really is no rush.
As to your ex, you have shown great strength to leave someone you felt wasn't treating you well or was making you think badly of yourself. I am not going to slate him as I'm sure he has his own side of the story. But you were together five years which shows you have no issues with commitment either. Both of these show some strength but, again, being single is not a bad thing. Be single for as long as you want or until you find the right person.
I keep coming back to the feeling there is a cultural reason for you wanting to be married/ with someone? That is very difficult for me to advise. However, maybe moving away of that is possible to be your own person and npt live the life others expect you to? If it's possible of course. I know we all like to think of life as being poilte but some people simply can not accept others ways of thinking so it is sometimes better to just move to where you are accepted for who you are, whether that be single, old, young, gay or 'weird'! The fight normally isn't worth it.
As for your relationships with guys then, again, it's hard to put a finger on the 'issue'. In fact a lot of issues are not gender specific - you can't help who you find attractive. I have seen plenty of women who I think are stunning, but some are horrible people! I also can't force myself to find attractive someone I don't just because they are a lovely person. If you are very attractive then you should only take it as a compliment. You will never stop people finding you attractive or not, it's uncontrollable. You dress how you want, you act how you want and then people can decide whether they find the outside of you attractive, you just be you.
You also seem to be relatively passive in your selection of potential partners, they don't just have to chose you, you have to chose them too. What are you looking for in a partner? I have only ever ended up dating girls I have been friends with for quite a time beore it ever turned romantic and that seems to be a good way to realy get to know someone. Especially if you're female and they only really after one thing! Again, if it's cultural it's different, but I don't understand the urge to speak about marriage so soon - I'll be honest, if any woman spoke to me about marriage after a few months I'd be running a mile!
As for men being friends with women and vice-versa, if there is an attraction there then it's hard not to want more - not just men. But I do believe it is possible to be friends with the opposite sex without there ever being anything else. However, if you find someone attractive and get on with them really well of course they are going to want to make it something more as what's missing?! You again should take it as a compliment that men seem to find you attractive and interesting! If you don't reciprocate their feelings and they can't handle it then that's their issue. I've been friends with women who I've quite 'liked' but haven't felt the same towards me so I accept it and remained good friends with them.
So in summary it's hard to answer you. If I could suggest one thing without offence, it'd be to think what YOU want. You need to be selfish for a bit - what do you want from life, what do you want in a partner, do you want to be single for a bit? Ignore parents, ignore society, ignore expectations. At least then you can find a path to where you want to be - you're never going to please everyone so the easiest thing to do first is please yourself. You're 26, you're not old, you give the impression you're at least attractive and interesting to those you meet and have friends and family who look after you, you are in no rush but just decide what YOU want.

"You both acknowledge there have been difficult times and that you've done a lot with your life already. I don't know how old you are but I'd suggest both of those things could be focused on to give you some reason for feeling as you do. Have you fully resolved the difficult times through grief therapy for example? And all the stuff you've done - what did you enjoy and why can't you do it again? They must be at least good stories.
Your job seems a big source of your feelings too. It is my belief that society makes us all believe we're supposed to love our jobs and this can lead to discontentment. If everyone loves there job then why do people quit when they win the lottery?! I think the key is to find a job you job don't hate, something that is just ok. You then use it as a means to and end - it brings in money that allows you to do the things you want to do. If you somehow find a job you love I think you're one of the lucky ones!
Again I may be oversimplifying, but you give the impression that if you were content at work you'd feel a lot better and that in itself gives you a goal. It may not be a quick fix but your goal could simply be to find a job that is simply ok, or accept that not everyone loves their job. Focus on the wage slip and what you can do with it, big or small.

"I think you should ask your doctor to refer you to a psychiatrist because there may be a chenical imbalance in your brain. I can assure you no one would be better off without if you thought of ending it. Everyone would be burdened with guilt that they hadn't done some thing to help and then there would be their grief. So your're going to have to find the strength to get more specialised help and have tests first.

"Thank you for your reply. I think it's fair to say people both know, and acknowledge, they have tried and they even admit there is little they can do to change my way of thinking - I'm called stubborn, over-thinking or too clever for my own good! I can turn almost any argument on its head. So whilst I accept they may be sad for a short time, I don't agree they'd feel guilty. I still just try to balance feeling sad for a while with having to put up with me 'forever' - shortest pain seems to be the first one.
I really can't face a doctor again.

"Hey, doctors can be a pain in the ass, certainly they are when checking for prostate. Anyway you might need to find a tipping point in life. Some adventure that takes you away from the doldrums. Nothing life risking, but like six to 10 months away. Perhaps at sea on a cargo ship, or go work on an oil rig in Norway, or serve meals for a summer high on the Alps. Something where you face life in a much different way. Hell, hears sheep in Montana. Anything that changes your daily same old same old.

"An adventure is a lovely theory, but an impractical reality. Fundamentally, how does one pay for this adventure? If I could spend six months backpacking around the globe I would. I'd be interested in teaching in an area that really needed it. But all of it is unrealistic - it costs thousands to even take part in volunteer programs, I've checked.
Aside from that, you're leaving family behind which is largely the only thing that can keep me remotely sane. Without which, despite any new perspective or revelation, I fear would finally destroy me. If I have one glimmer of hope (that can also be a reason to go conversely if you read above) leaving is the end regardless.
As for spell checker - it's worse than that for those on tablets or phones like myself, autocorrect is a nightmare!

If you read up on chemical imbalance and depression it will tell you that if you have this, there is no way you can 'turn yourself"" and you spiral down.

"Hi, I'm a retired teacher. i was passionate about getting the best results for the kids I taught. I did the best I could for them given their circumstances and the resourses I had. I left feeling I had made a difference to their lives because a Gcse in Maths improes choices. It also made me feel good about myself that I could do that. Maybe teaching just isn;t your thing. It's not for everyone. You have to have a strong back bone and a sense of humour to survive.
How do you feel about sex? Does that make you feel alive ? Does anything you do make you feel good ? I don't know how old you are so that makes a difference to your outlook. Have you had blood tests to see if your thyroid is functioning o.k. There can be reasons why you feel like this that are physical.You say you've had a relatively straight forward life so you have no idea of the pain of loss and so academic arguments may seem clever but you have no idea what the reality of life is.So you should be thinking of others to spare them that pain, if you love them.

"I loved teaching, but in today's world that only takes up about 5% of your job, the other 95% was paperwork, meetings, scrutinies, reports, data etc. Kids aren't kids anymore, they're numbers on spreadsheets. I found that in every school I worked in. And I taught EY, so absolutely no need for it. Judging and pigeonholing a child from 4 years old is disgusting. Making them 'fit' in to a subsection to please political remit is even worse. My sense of humour is not an issue, although perhaps my backbone is! I take criticism quite hard and acknowledge that. But I always tried to be better at what I did, or in fact anything I do. I can laugh at myself easily and had fun with the childrenthe but never felt accepted by staff as some openly question a male teaching young children. Looking young didn't help either - parent's thought I wasn't old enough! I'm in my mid thirties. Im not talking about my sex life on an open forum. But no, I've not had my blood checked for thyroid issues but have no problems with sexual function, body heat, shaking or weight issues. I don't have an appetite at all (as in I forget to eat and genuinely don't know what hunger feels like) but the only 'issue' I sometimes wonder about truly medical is whether I lack testosterone as I have a relatively child like frame (appetite doesn't help I suppose!), can't grow a beard at all, can be quite irritable (with myself, never others) and obviously, low mood.
I have experienced loss. But I know that time fixes everything, life moves on whether you want it to or not. It's a poor example but it's most accurate I can give you that is based on real, not academic, events. My grandparent had a horrible disease that was progressively worse and caused him, and those seeing this, pain for a fair few years. When he died the family was very sad but, underlying, was the sense he was no longer suffering, and therefore neither were they having to watch it. Now maybe it'd have been possible with loads of money etc to extend his life another 5, 10 years - but even if it's possible would you want to? Would you want to keep someone suffering, watch them suffering day after day just so they were 'there'? Basically, do you believe in euthanasia? Now I know mental health can not be put in the same bracket, but to dismiss it entirely would not fit with the consensus that it is a serious disease. I therefore argue that my 'suffering' and those watching my suffering would not want me to die but ultimately feel better quickly rather than trying to keep me suffering just so I'm here. That's love to me, it's recognising that as much as it may hurt you or you'd miss them, that they'd be happier elsewhere. It's no different to seeing a friend leave the country, you'll miss them and might never talk to them again but it's what they need to do for themselves. I don't think if you love someone you would force them to carry on suffering just for you. I also don't believe if you love someone you allow yourself to be the one that hurts them so you take yourself away.

I belive this modern/industrial/western way of life we were all unlucky enough to have been born into is the ultimate cause of our mental health issues.
I can't help but think that if we had been born at least a few thousand years ago, it would have been much easier to have a life that made us happy and fulfilled.

"I both agree and disagree!
There is no getting away from the fact we live very EASY lives, we shouldn't really dismiss how advanced as a civilisation we have become. I don't need to spell out the ways in which that is.
However I do agree it is also a contributory factor to some mental health issues: we have time to think rather than just survive, we have knowledge that makes us feel like we're missing out on things and finally I believe men in particular find it hard to cope in a world that encourages the 'hunter gatherer' type mentality but also has moved to a more equality based society. There are papers on it if you really want to research it.
Ultimately I believe knowledge is what hurts most, sounds odd really. But knowing you COULD do this or COULD have that is far worse than never knowing it existed. Loads of people would love to go to New York for example, they know all about it, but will never go for a variety of reasons and that makes them sad. They wouldn't be sad if they didn't know about New York. Now amplify that to more significant knowledge like love, money, friendship, society and I wish I knew less.
I often wish I was a cat! Simple pleasures, lots of sleep. Ambition and knowledge don't exist anywhere else other than in the human mind.

"Well, yes, you've explained my point better than I could already.
But I don't agree that easier = better, and I don't actually agree that it has actually become easier.
In the past everything we needed was free, but now most of us have to jump through hoops and go through untold amounts of stress just to hope to make enough money at the end of the month to make ends meet.

"I imagine we're straying wildly away from the crux of the thread but I think fundamentally we kind of agree. But even simple things like food and shelter are certainly easier now - even if you can't afford it, in this country anyway, you are provided for. Trade has always been used since civilisation was formed, even if the currency has changed so people have always had to jump through hoops to meet their very basic needs. Even now, if you think of absolute necessities, it's quite easy to achieve that - take away TV, phone, entertainment, snacks etc and absolute bare essentials (all people had hundreds of years ago) are very easy to achieve. The problem arises, we agree, when your wishes/knowledge grows. We should be happy to just want food and shelter but we are conditioned to want more, no one would be happy in this day and age without their luxuries. It's an extension on Maslow's needs - where true happiness comes from is really where your knowledge sits comfortably with your reality and your needs. So hundreds of years ago people hoped for house and food and were happy if that was largely comfortable, whereas now the 'basic' need is often a job, or a TV etc.
I slight caveat to that argument though is the situation I find myself in where my basic needs are more than met but I feel lost in an emotional sense - like a disconnect from society and expectations. If you feel depressed because of material concerns then I imagine that could be channeled into an ambitious career path. But I'm just guessing and could not possibly pretend to know even a single answer.
But to get it back on topic, I largely agree with you :D

"Glad we basically agree rsjg, just thought it would be interesting to try and get to the bottom of what the absolute cause of these kinds of problems is.
I have suspected this way of life is the ultimate cause of it for a long time, especially when we consider that its only been around for a few hundres years maximum, and then consider that Google tells me modern humans have been here for 200,000 years.
I really wouldn't be surprised if its this way of life which is indeed what's making us mentally sick, because its almost completely different to how we lived throughout the vast majority of human history.
For example, in this modern world, we're expected to be at a certain place at a precise time 5 days a week or more or you're likely going to get a telling off or even a possible sacking, but life wasn't really like that in the not too distant past - so I can see why even basic things like that can gradually take their toll on your mental health.
So lets put it into perspective and not be too surprised when people feel like their life isn't the way its supposed to be.

"I agree but doubt there is an absolute cause for any of it, I think we are lucky to live in the age we do but that also comes with some drawbacks naturally. Maybe as animals we should only be living to 30-40 but modern life has increased that. I also don't think mental illness is a new thing, we're just more aware of it now - it's that knowledge thing we spoke about. Today people rarely die of old age, there is a name for what made them pass away, a heart attack, pneumonia, cancer - these aren't new things, we just know about them now so they aren't just labelled old age.
But we're getting very academical in our discussions so, despite being quite interesting, I'll leave it there!
On a more personal note, dare I suggest some advice if I'm getting the issue behind your belief, if I'm wrong I apologise; don't waste time figuring out how it got to be like this (unless it is academic) but focus instead on how you can survive it. There are some things we can not change, we're not going to suddenly lose hundreds of years of evolution whether it'd be better for us or not, so forget it if you can. It can lead you down a horrible path when you focus on what could have been and yet have zero chance of changing it. So look out how you deal with the situation you're in, rather than dreaming the situation was different. That's not meant in an offensive way - I'm just trying to help.

"Hi, I'm feeling much the same at the moment - which is why I'm back on a depression forum...
HOWEVER. To give you some hope, I'm going to list some of the things that helped for me. I had depression for around 15 years, probably longer and kept plugging away, fighting it in every way I knew how. I had multiple courses of therapy and counselling, different anti-depressants, I even self-diagnosed with various illnesses because I was so sure that there was a biochemical reason for the depresssion, and wanted to fight the cause, not take anti-depressants for the effects. Long story short I have discovered a few things that help:
1. Therapy. Please don't give up with this, I had loads of useless therapy (eg. rubbish therapist/ wrongly targeted - I could tell you some stories!) but then had a course of psychodynamic therapy which was great. It didn't feel as though it was working at the time, but afterwards, I was in one of the situations which would normally upset me, and a switch went in my brain, and so much fell into place. AFter that I had 10 years of feeling pretty good. TEN YEARS. That's something to fight for, right? Just recently I'm starting to crumble again, but I've had those ten years, and I have hope I can get more with help.
2. Medication. I was tried on SSRIs, and to start with they worked ok-ish, but then I developed an intolerance to them even in tiny amounts, so my doctor tried me on an SNRI. It took me 6 months to settle into it, and for the panic attacks to subside, but it changed physical things I didn't know I was missing, for example, seeing colours properly. After 20 yrs of muted washed out colour (I didnt' even know what I was missing, thought it was normal) I still get joy out of looking at something as simple as a piece of vivid blue plastic.
3. On my endless quests for self-diagnosis for the CAUSE of the depression, I have discovered that Vitamin D3 really helps. I was prescribed around 3000iu a day. I now only take 2000 when I remember. This is not sounds science, just observation. Please do your own research. Oh, and I think you're supposed to take magnesium because vit D can deplete it.
4. I was recently diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME). The treatment in the UK is CBT and excercise. However, being stubborn, once again I refuse to just chat about how tired I am so I did my own research on the internet. I found a site which connects CFS with disturbances in gut flora (friendly bacteria) and the more I researched, the more I found that this is a very new area of study which is being properly investigated by actual scientists. The theory is that we all need a VARIETY of friendly bacteria and if you just keep topping up with yoghurt, you only get one kind. So I found a supplement on the internet with around 30 different kinds, and the good news is that it has not only given me more energy but improved my mood. Again, this is just my own observation, not double blind trials or anything, but to my mind, it's worth sticking with as it can't do any harm.
5. For the girls, get your iron levels checked. If you can't seem to supplement your iron fast enough, see your doctor about reducing your monthly bleed.
So yeah, I've spent 25 years fighting this thing that blights our lives. At the moment I'm not winning, and I'm very very tired of doing it on my own, but when I look back to how hopeless I was in my 20s I know I've come such a long way. I think what I'm trying to say is try everything, take every offer of help you get. You don't know what will make a difference - and some things will. Oh, and I do the same thing with the jokes with the therapist, it's rooted in the stigma of depression; try to let them in, they've seen it before and won't judge. If you do feel judged, find a new therapist.
I hope I've given you some ideas, and some hope. If not, then at least you know you're not the only one. Good luck.

"What a brilliant post. I say that because I COULDN'T pick holes in it or say it wouldn't work! I'll read it again properly later but being realistic, saying this MIGHT work and being honest is really enough to make me sit up and take a bit of notice. On a side note, point 5 might be applicable to males too, there is a chance pernicious anemia runs in my family but I haven't actually bothered to get checked - besides taking iron (or even some other vitamin tablets) seems to have an odd side effect where I get nosebleeds!
I probably need a lot more pushing to get back to a doctor/ therapist but at least you made me think. Ten years is worth a push, hell I'd take 10 days. Thanks.

"I'm glad I could help. I've used my body as a lab rat over the years, and I could tell you lots of things that DIDN'T work, and lots of illnesses I DON'T have, but these did so give them a try. If you want any more information on any specific part of this, let me know.
Yup I have side effects from taking iron too - if I take prescription-strength iron I sleep all day, so once again I have investigated every possible form of iron there is. I now take an over the counter one which is a fraction of the dose and more expensive, but which I can tolerate. Get it investigated first, then experiment if necessary.
I've had some dreadful doctors and a few awful therapists too (quick examples of bad therapy:
1) the chronic pain therapist I was sent to because the hospital didn't have anyone else who told me that my depression was like having had a broken leg and still limping after it had healed, and I should just stop limping and get on with life.
2) the psychologist who was obsessed with me saying that I sometimes had a glass of wine (literally one) in the evening after a stressful day to calm down, and made it his mission to get me to admit that I had an alcohol problem, to the extent of ignoring anything else I wanted to talk about. He didn't see the irony in himself not being able to function in the morning without coffee.
3) the psychologist who was unable to rephrase anything from her CAT printouts and shouted at me if I didn't understand them. This one actually did a lot of harm and should be struck off).
I would say, though, that as with all professions there are good and bad practitioners and if you encounter a bad one, keep shopping around til you get a helpful result. I've also had some amazing and humbling experiences of care beyond professional remit. There is no reason to stay with a bad doctor. Ever.
It occurs to me that while writing this, I have given the impression that every time I got a knock back I got straight up and started fighting. Of course that's not true. This is the distillation of 25 years of experience. Every disappointment has felt crushing, and it has often been years between each new attempt. If I can help anyone on here take a shortcut through that, then it makes all that time feel less lost.

"You're last paragraph is the most pertinent. Everyone is different but I appreciate the realistic honesty. Maybe it's where I am at the moment, not sure I have the emotional energy to 'go again' at the moment but the difference you've made is that my mind flicked from 'I'm done' to 'maybe I'll have the energy to try again another day'. Less black and white of give up or try but perhaps the grey may keep me going. If that makes sense.

"After reading through this thread, I feel like I need to reply. The biggest pop-up here for me was when you described yourself as 'boring'. Thing is, reading through this thread made I felt very drawn to you. I've never been drawn to a single 'boring' person, so I felt this had to be said. I don't want to go overboard as you clearly deal with compliments the same way I do. But simply because you don't drink, smoke or do wild things does not make you boring. You're clearly a very intelligent, insightful person. Your sense of humour also shines through on many posts. I would love to read a book, article or anything at all you wrote. I reckon there are some people who'd call being smart a boring thing, but they're just stupid, eh?
I recognize a lot of issues and ways of dealing with them. I've dealt with things much in the same way. I've lived in cycles aswell. Though mine focused more on periods where I could pretend I was fine and periods where I couldn't. I'm also very familiar with feeling boring, caring about people too much and just feeling like a burden in general. You're a lot healthier in that sense, I've managed to push absolutely everyone away from me for that. I feel our situations are fairly similar. I talk to my mother maybe once a month, sister even less. I suppose my 'gf' is my son, as I'm also 100% sure he'd be better off without me. He lives with his dad, who wants nothing to do with me. Besides them, I have no-one.
Honestly reading through this thread is quite bizarre, as a lot of the parts sound like they were written by me but altered by someone more intelligent. There's so much I can relate to. I used to feel like I had no reason for being depressed either, but some psychologists I've seen have made me realize there's actually quite many things. Have you ever considered the fact you might have something in your youth that triggered your depression? There's so many different, even insignifcant seeming things that can affect our psyche. Allthough personally I'm against the whole idea that all our problems stem from our childhood, I have to admit there is some truth to it. Some of the issues don't start popping up untill the later years. To me it seems like your caring side might be a part of the cause, it not the biggest, for your depression. But even if there's no ''real'' reason for the cause of your depression like you say, doesn't mean you shouldn't be. Even the smallest thing can start the downwards spiral, and leaving it unattended only makes you fall faster. Like me, I completely burned myself out in my youth, trying to help a person that didn't deserve my help to begin with. The burnout slowly turned into depression, which went on unattended and left me pretending I'm fine. Now it's in a point where I can't even pretend anymore. So I basically started depression from nothing like you say. Sure, during the time other stuff happened, before that and later on aswell. I can now say I have a very good reasons to be depressed, but the start? That was mostly due to my own stupidy and stubborness. I should have left the person I tried to help. If I had, my tale now, 10 years later might be very different.
I guess what I want to say is, you're too similar to me to be boring. *grin* And that there's no good or bad reasons to be depressed. Even if someone else suffered 'more', only the person in question can decide how much damage it did. Sometimes, it may seem as if someone deserves to suffer more because of their circumstances, but that doesn't mean you're not entitled to it. Pain is pain and it's all bad.
...Hmm. I hope that doesn't come off like I'm belittling your pain. That's not my intention, but I don't know how else to say it. That's me trying to sound smart and wise - not a good idea! Anyhow, wether you end up reading this or not - I wish you all the best. Keep that gf of yours, she clearly genuinely cares about you a lot. I'm sure you give her a lot more than you think. You actually remind me of a person I used to know a lot. He also couldn't see how great he was, despite his problems and ended up pushing me away. (it's not you though, don't worry, I don't live in the UK) But clearly you see something special in this girl to keep her around for so long - so don't throw that away. Fight on!

"Thanks for your comments. You're definitely right, I don't really pay much attention to any compliment - it sounds fake or like someone is patronising you. I know it's my issue but can't change it! A few people say I remind them of Jon Richardson (8 out of 10 cats) and I see it - well bar the success, clear complexion, growing confidence etc!! I think a lot of people use humour to cover their insecurities or lack of self-esteem and that's why I'd say a majority of people with depression aren't easily identifiable - we're not crying in the corner but being light and 'quippy' in public before getting home and lying on the bed so shattered from the public persona we try to portray. Funnily enough I was a writer before I was a teacher, albeit briefly but, surprise, I wasn't very good at that either - not enough original thought!
This 'smart' thing both irritates and interests me. I've mentioned previously, I feel that knowledge can be a bit of a curse. Yes there is the side of it being linked to being boring but there is also the feeling that ignorance is bliss. Don't get me wrong, I'm not intelligent in the slightest! I can get by etc but I know a million people who are way more intelligent that me, I'm very average... maybe just a little lazy too! I have never studied/ revised for anything but seem to manage but I'm certainly not a top of the class, super intelligent type! Me and a former colleague (teaching) used to comment 'who are the stupid ones?' the undereducated teen parents who are given all they need on benefits whilst seeing their friends and taking all kinds of illegal substances or us, working hard for no reason, little gratitude and a public perception that we're lazy?! Not a simple answer when kids are talking of their PS4s and how they're going to Disney World etc when you're struggling to pay for your student fees and afford the up coming MOT!! Ah, little rant unrelated to anything there!!
I have managed to push everyone away too, there is no-one but my GF and immediate family, but considering I come from a large family I can see that reducing too. I already don't speak to over half my siblings and finding the others increasingly hard work. My nephews used to be a highlight but they are growing up and no longer need the 'fun' (I could manage that around them!) uncle. I can see me losing contact with them all when my parents are no longer around as the 'glue'.
Having a son, whatever you feel, makes you incredibly useful and not a burden - at least not yet if I'm honest. You clearly love him so you are there for him and you're not doing anything to burden him, you don't make him pay your bills or pick you up from anywhere or try to make you feel happy. If you think about it, I bet it's quite a one way street as regards emotions like it is with most children/ parents. Even now, I think my parents help/listen to me more than I do them as that is their 'role' and they would have done the same with their grandparents. As long as you're not emotionally offloading on to him, despite how frequently you see him or directly impact on his life, I'd say it's impossible for you to be a burden on him. And to prove that isn't just a nice fluffy comment, I'll be honest and say that doesn't mean you are a great influence either; another words whilst you can't be a burden on him, how much help you are to him IS an avenue you can explore. Happily it is quite a nice one to think about; if you're only 10% a good mother to him now that's still a positive amount! And it means you're working form a positive to a positive if you want to have more of an impact on his life. Does any of this make sense?! Oh, and just for the record, I'm NOT saying you're a bad mother!! I'm just saying you basically can't be a burden (a negative) but you can only be percentages of a positive. In a linked way though, reaching my mid thirties, I point blank refuse to be a father as I feel I have nothing to offer a child and wouldn't make a good dad at any stage of their life. However, depsite that, I know I couldn't be a burden to any child. I can be a burden to my peers and my family who feel they should look after me and you may feel that too but I can basically guarantee your child doesn't see you as a burden and wouldn't be better off without you. Even kids who hate their parents would rarely be better off without them. I'm going to keep going on this one....! Write down HOW your child would be better off without you, I almost like the argument in that I can't think of a way even if I was trying to argue for arguing's sake!! When it comes to my gf I think she'd be better off financially (your son doesn't pay for you) that she could find a better partner (your son can't get a better mum - he's 'stuck' with you!) that she shouldn't have to put up with my crap (I doubt you share this stuff with your child) and I'm holding her back (it's impossible to hold a child back - even if you want to!!). Seriously, overstating my point but you are NOT a burden to your son and he would NOT be better off without you. If you don't feel like you're doing enough then that's another issue but it's a good one to focus on as anything you add to what you currently do is only adding positives on to positives. With kids you can only go from neutral to positive so just keep thinking of how to add more weight to the positive side if it bothers you.
I still greatly doubt things stem from my childhood. I had a fairly standard upbringing (although middle child syndrome?!) but the rest of my family are quite confident and loud. Half of them went super successful and the other half went off the rails and had families and struggled financially. Although a bit of a sweeping statement, both sides are happy with the choices they made to end up where they are. I went along the 'successful' route but ended up in the struggling financially destination. I did all the 'right' things but got nothing out of it. I ended up in the same place as they ones who did the 'wrong' things but without the fun, the family, the large social circles that come with those decisions! You're right about me caring too much - I recognise this and not in a martyr kind of way, but in a 'why do I care what a random stranger thinks of me but I really really do, kind of way. But that's also tied to self worth to some degree, someone else always deserves it more than me so I'll give anyone anything as I don't deserve it. I can work for hours on someone else's CV or train them to get a job they're probably not qualified for because they're nice people but I'll pay only lip service to anything that may benefit me. This isn't helpful in work as it's largely about self-promotion and 'look at me' rather than any actual qualities you may bring to the table.
The idea of depression being there is the worst thought I can have. If it's unfixable then I really don't want to continue. Would you keep a car with a broken engine? You try to fix it, but if all avenues have failed the you send it to scrap. I'm a write-off at the moment!
I'm going to jump down your message a little (I read and read again as I write) and say even though you were joking, you got the paranoid side of me out when you said it 'wasn't you' in regards to a guy you knew - the only way this works for me is knowing that no-one knows me and no-one I know reads this!! So, being slightly paranoid, I looked at a few other posts you'd written in different threads. The reason I'm mentioning this is, to get off the boring topic of me for a bit, is that I don't think you give yourself enough credit for both what you've had happen to you or how you have dealt with it. Returning to where I was in your message, I don't think your issues have appeared from nowhere at all and you have valid reasons for feeling the way you do. You also recognise that you are worth more than some people demand. It is not wrong to make mistakes, it's wrong to not recognise them as mistakes (even if you make them a million times again!!). I'm no expert at all, but at the 'start' maybe you didn't give yourself enough leeway/slack and that's what kicked off the rest of the stuff - you probabaly were depressed at the start but just didn't think it was important enough to get depressed over!
I recognise that everyone is different and a minor set back for one can be a significant mountain for another. I agree completely with you, pain is pain and circumstance and history do not dictate what should hurt and what shouldn't. We should all try to accept we can't change the past so there is no point thinking about it really, where's the benefit in it? So we should plan a route to the future. You don't need to be happy now, you just need to plan a route to where you might be happy in the future. We'll stumble and fall along the way but I believe that if you can plan that route to where you want to be then there is always enough hope to carry on and be happy it small successes even if you never get exactly to where you want to be. The issue I have is I can no longer see a destination or route that will achieve those goals.
You come across smarter than you think. You recognise a few issues that have resulted in you being where you are and if you can plan a route to where you want to be then maybe there is hope for you. I've beaten you in to submission by telling you it's impossible for you to be a burden to your son and hope you seek the support you need from the places you need it.
I didn't feel like you were belittling my pain at all, far better to just write as you feel rather than try to pussyfoot around tricky subjects. I'll probably end up pushing my gf away, I always do but you're 100% right in that she is special - but that in itself makes it less likely that I can persevere as it means she deserves far more than I am capable off.
You can't leave your son, even if you do you're never actually gone so it's kind of pointless. You'll always be his mum. You can't be an ex-mum! Once he arrived, that's it. So, again recognising I have no education on the matter, I'd recommend you forget thinking you can be a burden to him (as you can't) and think about how you can add to his life. Even the best mums in the world COULD do more, so if you're going to sacrifice everything for him then you can do that positively. in a ridiculous scenario you could devote your whole life to him, every penny you have goes to him, every minute he's available you're there for him. If you want to give up your life, then just give it to him instead! On a more serious note though, if you take this line of thinking on board, you may find there are secondary benefits - say you can pick him up from school x number of days a week, you get to know a few other mums who are standing by themselves waiting for their kid (ignore the bitchy gaggle of parents that are present in every class group!!) and that begins to widen your social group. Take him to a club once a week (football, athletics, cinema - whatever you have around you) and again you may find a few like minded souls. You may find instead of feeling like a burden to him you feel like you are enriching his life even a little. And from my point of view, you may sudddenly find he's started enriching yours from a direct point of view but also from the secondary ones noted above. Your son gives YOU a reason to fight; you can help each other.

"I am a little confused rsig. Now to start, I am not trying to offend, and I will limit my criticism. You have responded to every post, and some of your advice is good. Not that any of your posts are bad in any way, because they are not. My questions is what are you looking for? I have walked this planet for the past 40 years feeling the same as you've described. Your statement ""I feel like I'm not really worth anything"" perfectly describes my state of mind. And no, I do not self harm or have the desire to - don't panic. But, feeling this way for so long, and living in isolation (to a certain degree) for all of these years has left me reading about this problem, but not really caring for what others have to say. Noone can totally feel like I do. And the reverse is true as well. No one really cares when I speak, what my issues in life are, nor my achievements in life. Your profile seemed quite similar, except you seem to communicate with everyone who writes and you offer quite a lot of advice. So what ARE you looking for? How can you describe me so well through your self description, yet be so different on this forum. Just curious. It may be helpful to me. And BTW - yes, I AM selfish. But I have earned it. Sad, eh?

"I'm not offended at all - it's quite hard for me to be offended despite being quite sensitive to criticism as it's all I 'hear' in a conversation.
So to try to respond to your comments I'll summarise it as 'fair point' and 'I don't know' and 'it's complicated'!
Your comments are certainly fair in there sometimes seems no continuity in my thought processes or actions; I shy away from people but answer everyone on here, I struggle to see worth in myself yet see the hope in others, I have no fight in my own life but urge others to fight in theirs. Why this is I'm not sure. I completely agree with you though - no-one else feels totally like you do, you (and I) are unique in our being and whilst similarities may be strong, we are bound to deviate in places and have different triggers, wishes, desires and flaws that need facing in a unique way.
So what am I looking for? Good question. I don't know. Not to feel like I do? Not to cry sometimes for no reason? To feel hope for the future? To forget the pains of the past more readily? To feel useful? All of these and a million more things to different degrees of importance. Maybe knowing what I'm looking for would even be enough. It's a very good question but I don't know the answer.
So finally, why do I respond on here? Complicated. Again, there is no one right answer. Fundamentally I feel a strong compulsion to reply to every message, like it's polite to. Then there is the element where it makes me feel better to feel useful (advice). There's also the human part of me that craves interaction, having no friends and being home alone for long hours. Maybe part of me (certainly at the begining) that was hoping for the 'magic wand' to make myself feel better. Some of it is boredom, some of it is helping others and some of it is helping me. Why do I find it easier to chat on here? Simple; you don't know me, it's the most honest I can be. I don't even picture what the person I'm writing to looks like. Weirdly, I'm acting the most human I ever do when I treat those I am communicating with as if they are a simple computer. I'm just reading text and replying to text, it's almost as if there isn't another person reading it. That probably makes little sense.
So to try and answer you, and maybe help you as you suggested, the answer is I don't know! Do you know what would make you happier? You must have some hope or wish for a better mental health if you're on these boards at all.
I think, for both of us, the reasons and the solutions will be highly personal and yet relatable with many but not 'one'. Maybe that's why I reply to everyone; I don't expect anyone to be a replica of me but I see an element of them in myself. Some more strongly than others. So by identifying and helping an individual, I perhaps help a small part of myself.
Unfortunately, and I recognise the stupidity, I am the epitomy of 'do as I say, not as I do'! So whilst I recognise the right mindset, the right choices and the right attitude, I still struggle to see it in myself. Who know's, may be were both a little 'happy' being grumpy?! I do say this without any sense of drama at all, but I genuinely hate myself, my way of thinking, my cynicism and my pessimistic nature. I wish I was the chilled, confident, positive and believed in something person I want to be but feel I've reached a point of no return. Almost like I now know too much to be happy. I've said it before, ignorance is bliss but I can now not escape my feelings and knowledge of the future to be happy.
Finally (actual finally!) the person who writes on here is nothing like the person you'd meet in person. I'm not chatty, I won't offer advice, I wouldn't mention there was a problem and I would share feelings. Whilst many use the internet to portray the person they want to be (edited), I use it to feel free enough to just release and save the edited version for the increasingly limited interaction I do have.

"I'm not even sure I have depression, I think this may just be 'me'.
I have always been pretty useless socially, but have had a normal upbringing, no horrible experiences, have gone through education fine and even got jobs but I've never enjoyed life, never really cared and normally feel like I'm not really worth anything and, inevitably enventually, will become a burden.
I'm not going to be dramatic and say I'm going to end it, it sounds so pathetic (no offence intended to anyone) but I have thoughts of 'going' or even dreams that I could die 'blamelessly' thorugh accident or illness. Selfish I know.
I have a cycle. Get job, put on confident easy going persona, get physically tired from doing that, lose energy to maintain job, focus on negative, leave job in some form (fired/quit). Friends are much the same, play easy going fun, can't keep it up, lose or push them away. Relationships, get attracted to ones who need help, help them in anyway I can, get to a point where I feel I am no more use so should go as they'd be ultimately better off.
So, currently I've quit my job as a teacher, couldn't take it - always something to improve and with my way of thinking that just sounds like constantly someone telling you you're useless (and it backing up your own thoughts anyway) but even though I liked aspects of my job I don't think I had a passion like I see in others. I felt I'd let everyone down so disappeared, my partner/ parents got me through immediate days after my sudden departure from work and saw Doc who was nice enough - put me on medication which seemed to do very little - even after a few months. In fact it only had negative side effects so about three weeks ago I stopped taking them completely. I also started seeing a CBT person about three/four session ago but this feels like it's doing nothing at all either, we talk, I'm honest as I can be but there is some element of being 'public' and putting on that face/ jokey responses.
I dip between a wish to not be around that is forever there and seems to be backed up with wholly logical reasons that people genuinely struggle to refute to absolutely crashing panic attacks/ given up when my 'theories' are proved.
I know this sounds odd, but I don't even have the will to get 'better', largely because I don't think I can. I am just 'me'. I am negative, boring and even if it is all just selffullfillng profecies - it's still me who has done that. I'm not blaming life, or others or anything else.
A lot of the posts I read on here seem to have good reason; PTS, loss, finances etc - does anyone have no 'good' reason?
I just feel I'm never going to be happy, I am soon to be much a burden on those around me (my gf) and that, in the long run, it'd be better for all if I just went. I know my family and gf love me - but time heals, life would get better and people move on. In the long run I'm sure it wouldn't effect my family and 100% sure my gf would be better off.
Not sure if there is an answer for this, just writing. I'm not angry, I'm not hurt, I'm not even sad as such, I'm just tired...

"My compulsion to reply...!
You've given very little information but if you believe you've got everything you wanted and achieved everthing you wished then it points to a chemical imbalance. Have you sought medical advice?
Alternatively, your problems may stem from something hidden so deep inside you (as you can't recognise it) that you'll need some therapy to unlock the issue.
My problem is me as a person, but you seem to indicate yours might be more just a feeling/ unsettledness that you can't pin down. To give you some hope, I believe if you can find the cause of the issue you may be able to begin to solve it.

"So nice to know that I am not the only one with these feelings. I am 28 Indian Male working in Canada. I feel tired of life all the time. I never feel happy and always find negative in everything. I just want to go to sleep forever. I have been having these mood swings since I was 10-12 year old even though i had no major issues/problems in my life.
I don't think anything can fix this but there are a few things I did and helped me a little. I consistently work out. Cardio activities especially running helped a lot in getting rid of that frustration and get a better sleep. I recently started writing some blogs and stuff just to pass some time.
There were times when things were really bad and i had no other option but to talk to my friend and pour my heart out. I am lucky enough to have one such friend. Some words of encouragement from someone you respect and value can come a long way in easing the pain.
I listen to a lot motivational/inspirational videos on youtube. It is like a daily dose of pill for me. It does help me believe that even though life is not fun and seems hard there is always hope.
I won't say this got rid of the mood swings but the mood swings are less frequent now, i haven't had a cigarette for over 2.5 years. I switched to a better paying job. I am healthier and all the workouts gave me a good physique
Unlike the normal advise that we get about going out with friends, meet new people etc. didn't work because i am kind of introvert (guessing most of us are ) and it takes me sometime to become friends with someone i don't know.

"Sorry for the delay replying to your post, I have been away. One sure way of feeling better is escaping the reality of your being, if only it didn't make the return so much harder!
Everything you say actually seems quite positive, which obviously is a good thing. You have found what at least helps you manage your symptoms, I suppose your next step is to see if there is any hope of resolving the issues that cause the symptoms. But, like me, maybe they aren't resolvable and are just 'you'.
You're healthy, in a better paid job, looking good and have a friend who you can talk to freely. When I have any one of those I'll see if they helped Health is ok, but have always been of the skinny frame regardless of what I do, I don't have a job has can't keep up the right frame of mind so leave before I collapse, and definitely have no friends to share this with. Well, I have no friends so that kinda says it all!
Anywho, I'm glad you seem to be managing quite well and controlling your mood. Canada sounds fun, if cold, and always think it shows an element of bravery to live and work abroad (I assume that's what you meant by saying Indian in Canada rather from Canada). Thanks for your message anyway.

"I think i know how you feel... growing up i was always the smallest, the weakest, the least tallented, the one everyone had to slow down for just to keep up. I felt absolutely useless like nobody needed me and I thought that if i just weren't there that maybe everyone would be able to continue and succede at what they wanted to do without having to worry about me. After i realized these thoughts, i fell into a depression. Honestly i didn't even feel depressed. Not angry, not sad, not alone, just helpless and dissapointed in myself... I didn't want to die necessarily, nor did I want to live. i just didn't want to have to exist. After I finally made the decission to follow through with the former I was suddenly thrown into an array of situations that I couldn't leave unsettled, and because of that I had to force myself to get over my problems. If i was expendable, I told myself, then maybe I could at least be of some use. None of the situations have been resolved yet I've found that by helping them, I was able to help myself become the person who could help others, the kind of person I'd grown up both admiring and cursing. If you want to contribute to other people then first you have to help yourself. Find something within you worth saving and force yourself to do something, even if you're ready to collapse. Eventually You will find something in life worth hanging on to and equally as dependant as you. and Your family and girlfriend all love and treasure you. My father and grandfather were estranged during my grandfather's death and everyone involved regreted the separation afterwards. You can't afford to accept things as less than acceptable. because everything in life is worth you. and you are woth it.

"Thanks for your message. I'm glad you have found some way of helping yourself.
However, it's a common theme: help yourself by helping others. Most people would say I do that TOO much. I will help others endlessly to the detriment of myself as I value anyone's progress above my own. I have given up things for myself to help a near stranger succeed above me. Especially at work, I often actively passed praise on to others or accepted blame that was not mine to save them. It's actually quite harmful if you think about it as it just helps fulfill a belief you have about yourself.
Helping others hasn't helped me. I still do it too, not like I've given up with that tact as it is ingrained in to my personality. But it doesn't make me feel better about myself, it doesn't make others think better of me (I'm almost invisible) and, despite continuing with quite altruistic actions, I firmly believe there is no justice - the good don't get rewarded and the bad don't get punished. I actually think being nice is BAD for me.
In fact I believe the happy successful people in life are, by and large, the ones who don't dwell on the views of others either negative or positive and just take and use as they see fit to progress. That can be in a postive, go getter super confident way or it can be in a negative stab people in the back kind of way. However being focused on yourself and being selfish is by far the best way of succeeding in this world.
I'm going to stop there. I think you've caught me on a bad day. I didn't realise it, but maybe I'm feeling worse today than I thought - I knew I was irritable and this message has just proved it!

"Hi I think helping others is admirable and can help you learn about yourself and other people. But if carried to extremes can be a way of avoiding thinking about and dealing with your own problems. As you have said this doesn't work.
Being nice is good but there are limits you need to impose. You need to spend some time being selfish and looking after yourself. It doesn't make you a not nice person but does mean you will get more of what you want to in life.
In my experience most people will take advantage of nice people and can end up treating you like a doormat and are not grateful, often they are quite the reverse.
Draw up limits to helping others and learn to say no. It will feel wrong to you but it is actually right for you. We all need to look after ourselves in life coz no one else is going to do it for you are they? Decide what you are willing to do and what you won't do. I would always help someone at work for example and have done but would draw the line at taking the blame for them or jeopardising your own career or happiness. Find the line and draw it. x

"haha i guess it probably isn't exactly the healthiest of habbits, and basically everything you stated is true, but it works well enough for me i suppose. i hope you get to feeling better and i think that its very noble of you to take the actions that you do. I agree with both you and hypercat. I try to be kind to kind people and not so kind to not so kind people. a kind of physical karma i suppose. after all, if you dont take care of yourself then you cant take care of others.

"I will caveat the following by saying I am currently not close to taking any 'action', although I'd be lying if I said it wasn't always in the background, like a craving it's sometimes stronger than other times...
Anyway, this might sound very messed up, and I even recognise this, but I know a part of my seclusion from the world is to avoid unnecessary pain for others through any decent human's response to loss. I'm not stupid enough to think people wouldn't care, I just think they shouldn't. I also feel that people are sad about a strangers death, you can't be sad about something you don't know though...
My old friends know not where I am, haven't heard from me in years, and I will be nothing but a memory for them now. So if I were to 'disappear permanently' it wouldn't effect them. This has been part of my thinking. It genuinely means that all those thoughts that go through my head are tempered by evaluating how I could cause the least (zero) pain to those I know, or even strangers - I'd never do the train thing, I think that is selfish. There are ways without inflicting it upon others (which I won't go in to for any ideas for people who are closer than I am at the moment!)
I tried the medical route after twenty years of dealing with it myself, that too didn't work. I try not to think about it at the moment, because every time I do, I feel there is no hope.
I'm ok at the moment, the problem comes when work starts for my other half again and I'll be left thinking. Thinking is never good!

"Hi it's fine to keep suicide on the back burner so to speak. I have always done this when I managed to change my life and give myself a chance to make it how I wanted. The background thought is well I can always take the suicide option if I want can't I? The secret is to avoid it and put it off. I have put it off indefinitely and will never say never but I am 61 now and have made a good life for myself - enough that I have managed to avoid suicide for many years.
Every so often I weight up my options and decide do I want to carry on or do I take the get out of jail card. Even if I decide on the latter I decide I won't do it that day but maybe tomorrow. Tomorrow comes and I go ok made it so far will think again about it tomorrow. Eventually it fades into the background again.
I find it very comforting to have that option as it gives me peace of mind and control over my own life. If life gets really bad and I do it ok I bought myself many years and now it's time.
You have got to give yourself chances first and explore everything and try everything else before you decide to give up. x

"That,s really pleasing to hear..I know that just because people have thoughts regarding suicide, sometimes frequently I might add. This does not increase the risk. ..I can see the point of the seclusion bit, and wanting to push people away because the impact of whatever would be less severe.. Been there, done that, then realised how absurd that was. However I still refuse to go out and avoid people at all costs, so maybe not that absurd at all..jx

"Is it absurd?! I say with a smile, but to me it is all so logical! I have this half-running joke that ""my logical is undeniable"" as in the quote from I-Robot where there is a robot who wants to stop humans from harming themselves by denying them all freedoms and choices. Really the logic is undeniable! If no-one knows me, and that group gets smaller every year, then inevitably eventually I will just be able to disappear without anyone being the wiser. No-one will know, no-one will care. I will acheived my goal of just fading rather than shocking anyone or forcing them to respond in a way, you'd hope, all humans respond to the loss of someone they know.

To be fair, I have not really had to work at intellectual things, they kind of just make sense or I research everything the nth degree until they do but I wouldn't class myself as clever! It seems impossible to do so when one can't even speak to someone without stumbling over words or stressing or completely losing all grip on what I meant to say!
Although the madness part of King George I might be close to. Stephen Fry is an idol of mine, and someone I watch closely for obvious link in the field of mental health but if he's Premier League I'd barely count as a part time player!

"Dear rsjg,
Firstly I would just like to enquire after your relative health and whether you are still alive or not. Sorry if this sounds callous, but it is a mental health site after all and I have a terribly dark sense of humour!! I do so hope you are still alive, even though I realise you find this 'living stuff' all a bit pointless, which I can definitely relate to at this point in my life.
Anyway, my initial reason for contacting you, other than that I think you are a very thoughtful and articulate person, albeit one prone to depression and excessive rumination as I am, is that I am curious about your reasons for leaving the teaching profession. You see I have just had a terrible experience as a supply teacher in a British state high school, largely due to the execrable behaviour of this current generation of high school kids as well as the laughable 'discipline and support system' that currently operates in British high schools. I am from Australia originally, although I have taught English and Dance in various capacities in 5 countries now, but I have to say the behaviour I have seen in schools over here is the worst Ive seen ANYWHERE!!! Have you read 'You're wasting your own time'??? (Written by a British ex teacher). Because in my experience it's all true!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes so my long winded point being I wondered if part of the reason you left teaching was because of the hideous behaviour of the students here? Certainly if that was at all a factor, I also just wanted to say I dont blame you and nor do at least half the British teaching profession who eventually end up leaving for another field!
To finish my own rant here, I'm still recouperating after the shattering experience I have just gone through... still very disorientated, still weighing upmy options but ABSOLUTELY DEFINITELY NEVER SETTING FOOT INSIDE A MIXED ABILITY STATE HIGH SCHOOL EVER AGAIN!!! They're worse than farm animals if you ask me!!! And I'm not bothered if that sounds elitist. It's the sad truth! The system has fallen apart such that it now just molly coddles and panders to the dysfunctional whilst it penalises any hard working kids in the school AND the staff!
Ok, that's it from me. Have thought about topping myself after 7 yrs of wasted tertiary education but hey, maybe I'll just go and do what every other failed unemployed graduate does...start driving a cab!
This actually doesnt seem such a bad idea to me anymore. No more thuggish swearing brats to deal with, no more inept discipline procedures to endure, no OFSTED inspectors breathing down your neck,and no more stupid bureaucratic box ticking or paperwork to complete! It's a win win, as long as you can cope with the odd drunk babbling or toff twittering in your ear!
Ahh well, such is this absurd thing we call life!
Hope you sort yours out whilst I'm stumbling around trying to find mine!

"Still alive, well a bit tired but still class as alive, just
I'm going to have to be brutally to the point, in the nicest way I can, and with that I'll have to make some assumptions that I apologise for completely if I'm wrong - it's what you have to do when responding with limited information!
First, you obviously are at a very low point but you indicate this seems to be entirely in response to your work experience. That doesn't mean you're not depressed, far from it, but it does give you a relatively easy target to focus on to improve your overall well-being. If you were happy in work do you think you would be happy (as much as anyone is as they seek more!) with your life? If the answer is yes, then you need to focus on how to make either teaching, or any other career, work for you and your head.
Teaching. Man, I could rant too! However, I would temper that by saying every school is WILDLY different. Just because one is awful doesn't mean all are. Inner city in this country tends to be a lot harder to teach, where as suburbs and rural areas can tend to go the other way and have very unrealistic pushy parents. State school is not your enemy though. I have taught in a lot of schools and you wouldn't believe how they can change from one side of the road to the other. Staff make a far bigger impact than children. I like to believe all children are inherently pleasant and want to achieve, the only thing that lets them down can be parents/environment, poorly organised schools and... yes stupid government policies! But this is largely a chat for TES site - head there if you've not before and you'll get a lot better answers to teaching issues than I can provide. I also worked primary and, by and large, my issue was always with staff who still act like they are on the playground as they know no world different from education and still think the popular, loud, bully kids are the ones who run the joint! I am often secluded because I'm male. However, again, I also recognise that it is also a large part of me that struggles to deal with things rather than letting it not effect me - basically what I'm saying is I personally feel my character is not really strong enough to deal with one of the most demanding professions in the world - especially in this country. Most of the public would laugh at that statement but they don't realise the daily abuse, work, stresses, observations, impossible targets etc - it is the most mentally challenging job out there and when you go home you still have work to do, none of this leaving it at the office, still got to plan and mark and assess. I know (knew) police officers, nurses, labourers, lawyers who all turned to teaching for holidays and the view working with kids was fun (which it can be) but then all returned to their orignal jobs when they realised the mental strain it puts on you and those around you. No-one should say it's easy til you've tried it - there is no other profession in Britain where you can be watched working and assessed on a weekly basis.
But I try to tell me, and I'll tell you, that it doesn't make you a bad person if you can't cope in British schools. I wouldn't chastise a child for struggling in P.E. and it's the same thing, some of us are made to excel in some areas and underperform in others. If you think you are a good teacher elsewhere in the world (and on a side note all the people in this thread who are from x country but working on y country make me feel evern more useless - how cool and brave you all are!) then maybe it's a case of just finding the right school. If not, try something else I suppose. I am struggling to give you a good answer because this paragraph is one of my big daily mental battles.
Again, from what I read, I think you might find more help from TES website to reslove teaching issues, that may then feed in to your general mental wellbeing.
Good luck

"Hello again, and thank you for your detailed reply.
Ahh yes, well to be more candid, my crappy experience at a state high school which was mishandled by my agency, the school involved and resulted in an unfair suspension, continues!! However I have now spoken to the senior LADO for the area and who was incredibly sympathetic and has given me avenues to clarify the situation. Hopefully my career wont now be completely blighted by an errant 13 old and his gormless friends. Unlike you, I don't see children as all sunshine and light I'm afraid. But that's my knack for realism.
Thanks also for your tips regarding the TES. I am already familiar with them and dont think they can be of any additional help at the current time. At present in fact my lawyer and the surprisingly cooperative LADO are my best points of reference.
I did however wish to point out that unfortunately NO my depressive tendencies are not confined to my dissatissfaction with the teaching profession altho it has to be said the recent situation has certainly tipped me over the edge. (Not that you could have known that so please dont think I have taken any offence by yr assumptions). No unfortunately added to my mix are some residual unresolved family issues, disgust at the racial discrimination I and so many other ethnic minority people have suffered in various industries growing up in western countries and beyond that the particularly soul crushing addition of being an ex ballet dancer who is probably in a state of career transition - even though she'd happily break her left leg to be back on the stage again!!! Haha. Yes truly, with all that on my plate it's enough to want to grab your dinner knife and end it all. So I of all people, with this amount of baggage to claim do understand how tiring this life is. Presently I feel I have no energy at all. Have tried so hard in this life to achieve something exceptional and to what end? It all just seems a fatuous waste of time. Anyway, I do hope you find something to inspire you to go ahead with your life but I do warn you, put to much heart and soul into it and it can be equally if not more devastaing. Seems to me a life sitting on a couch could be far more peaceful for most of us given what is out there!!!
And so sorry, Im sure this hasnt helped you very much. I just thought It was important to share the fact that depressive apathy and directionlessness might not actually be quite as bad as seething resentment and bitter disappointment!!! I mean personally I think I'm kind of warming to this whole new lifstyle of utter zombie-dom. It sure beats the desire to go around nuking the negligent and detestable!!!
Anyway all the best to you rsjg and anyone else out there who's troubled. It seems we all have our idiosyncratic crosses to bear. Sincerely hope we all get some respite soon, in whatever way is best for each of us!

"I feel like I could easily spend hours and hours writing to you as regards your mindset and its direct correlation with teaching in particular, however it's probably not a suitable place and is arguably still too public.
I recognise issues can tip you over the edge and it certainly sounds like you have plenty of reasons to not be happy at the moment. You have clarified that it wasn't just a bad experience but a career tthreatening one. So whilst my advice to speak to fellow teachers on TES may help with the more general issues, you sound like you're getting the right support and advice in dealing with the bigger picture. I can empathise, I had a similar issue with unions and cases etc (capability procedures against me which were eventually proven to be bullying from them) but I can say even after that experience I have found occasional good schools/ staff. I don't believe all children are lovely, I'm not stupid ha ha! But, and this might be more relevant in Primary, I still believe it is the staff that largely dictate the environment you work in, from direct interaction with you to how the kids respond to them, the routines and the expectations.
I can't empathise with any discrimination you feel you have had but I would say, as you probably well know, that general statements such as x industry or y people don't like me working there isn't fair as there are varying individuals in every part of life and some (hopefully a majority) would not discriminate at all. The closest I have felt to discrimination would be being a male in a very female dominated and being openly questioned and judged or secluded for that. But I would never suggest all teachers or education is like that, it's just unfortunate there are any.
I recognise the want to give up. I really do. In fact, in short periods, I would argue it's a good thing to do. Especially in your circumstances, maybe a time out and a recharge is what you need before you make any decisions.
I'll ignore you advice to not try to hard, I agree with it, but it's probably not very healthy! One slightly cheesy line I sometimes repeat to myself is ""how can you be happy if you've never been sad?"" You need to know there are peaks and troughs and the zombie, nothing effects you life won't help. I know I'm sad now, I know that I've been sad for ages but I just hope that means that I'll recognise and appreciate if and when I'm happy. If that makes any sense...!
One final note, and apologies for any further assumptions, but you actually come across as quite the opposite from giving up. You sound like you have a lot of fight in you, anger and disappointment in the world and with that will inside you, you may find some form of talk therapy wouod help you greatly with every aspect that gets you down. Therapy doesn't work for me because I can't escape the blame I put on myself, the dislike I have for myself and my unwillingness to fight or talk through apathy. But you sound like you may benefit as you seem to show signs that you know you're good at things and have that desire to change the world!
Good luck with your next steps anyway

"I apologise for this post to be slighly off the run of the mill. I don,t really know why this needs to be mentioned, other than the fact that it had such a profound impact on me....(.As brief as poss)...2years ago I was daily visiting my Dad as he fought his cancer.( which I might add survived x2 ). Anyway it was on one of these such visits I came across the cancer unit specifically for teens. As I peered through the glass at them, all I could see was fun, laughter, lots of laughter it was almost infectious. In that brief moment a huge wave of guilt came over me...guilt for feeling so sorry for myself. The thought of losing my Dad, tearing away at me piece by piece. So many people fighting for each breath, a new day etc and yet they still found some form of enjoyment from the desperate situation that they were in..How dare I sit in this huge pile of self pity?, What right did I have contemplating my own demise?. A very humbling experience for me how could it not be for anyone?. This brief encounter completely put things into some form of order, order in my chaotic mind..I am not for one minute implying that wallowing in self pity is your style. Just thought I would share..Good Luck jx

"I'll be brief in my response as I recognise it is kind of unarguable!
First great that your Dad survived twice and pleased that, whatever the trigger was exactly, that the process went someway to helping you form order in your mind.
However, I touched on it previous messages to posters - you are a hundred percent correct in that perspective should mean that a majority of those with depression/ anxiety/ other mental health issues should find it easy to see how lucky they are. Unfortunately it doesn't work like that, otherwise no-one well off would suffer, no-one with great health would suffer. The mind understands but still can not process.
I will not speak for others but as valid a comment as yours is about perspective, and one I have thought of a billion times before too (why can't I just be happy, people in 3rd world countries would love to be in my shoes), it doesn't work and worse still, can make my thought processes even worse as I beat myself up for being depressed when I have no right to. Further knocking my self-worth! Another words, when I think of your perfectly fair comment myself, I hate myself even more than I currently do.
I have no reason to feel like this, a lot of people above me do - lost love, money issues, health issues, work issues, troubled past etc... so that just makes me even more pathetic, even more useless, even more disgusting a waste of space that I can't get... perspective.
Please don't see this as me attacking you, I'm really not!! I'm glad it worked for you - my attack is at myself!!

"Please don,t continue to attack yourself over this. You are not pathetic or a waste of space, you are depressed. I can,t even imagine not knowing the reason why you feel the way you do, more difficult I can only guess .. Being able to express why xyz is happening makes those of us that feel depressed get some respite from the merry go round of looking for the answer.....Sometimes we don,t find the answer. I genuinely apologise to you, for causing you more distress and anguish as that was not my intention at all...Sorry rsjg ( and that was the brief version ) take care jx

"Please don't apologise - all me, none you! I must admit I half envy those that have a good reason to feel the way they do, but then again I don't envy the frustration at not being able to fix or forget the causes people recognise.
Screw it, today I'm basically listening to Rachel Platten's 'Fight Song' on repeat at the highest possible volume in the hope it'll turn me 'off' for even just one day. I might be acting like a teenage girl but it's half working!

"Hi Rsjg,
Sorry it's taken me so long to reply. Given your own experience of the British education system and its circumlocutory bureaucratic procedures, you can no doubt appreciate that I was up to my neck in red tape. So much so I could easily have hung myself several times over. Anyway I am here to report that fortunately I have not had to resort to that. The other main reason I stopped by was just to let you know that the allegation against me mounted by a child wanting to get a teacher into trouble, just because they could, HAS BEEN DROPPED! When the police sought a statement, the family and child ignored all queries. Multiple messages were left by the school and liaison officer which they didnt bother to respond to over a two month interval so it is all now pretty much done and dusted. I'm just waiting for the paperwork to come through which is a mere formality. In other words, NO FURTHER ACTION IS GOING TO BE TAKEN. I am deeply relieved and it is gratifying to know that at least sometimes the wrongly accused do get some justice in this world. Having said that, the whole ordeal has deeply shaken my faith in the state education system and certainly proven to me how vulnerable teachers are within it. So I think I may look at a new career or at least make a return to tutoring and or dance instruction. SO HOW DO I FEEL NOW MENTALLY? LIKE A WHOLE TRUCK LOAD HAS BEEN UNLOADED, THANK GOD!!! However it is early days of my new job seeking routine so no doubt that will throw up some significant hurdles. Furthermore the ""other stuff "" I need to sort out in my life/head and or fight for will take time, so yes I think a return to a therapist will be my next port of call.
I read something from another of yr responders who said that a gifted athlete who suffered a chronic injury and was never quite able to get back to peak performance decided to top himself. ""Hmm"" I thought to myself, I can definitely relate. [Sorry if that sounds terribly egotistical]. I also read anout yr reaction to Robin Williams. Yes I found that very disturbing also. I think poor old Robin was at times plagued by his tendency for perfectionism and the need to better his best all the time. And let's face it, who can keep that up for a lifetime??? But as well as all his inner turmoil, I think he had a profound awareness of the unfairness and chaos of this life we all share. And I think all rolled up together, it all just got too pointless and or too painful for him to bare...Anyway that's my take on that. No bloody use to anyone quite probably, but thought I'd air those thoughts anyway.
As for you Rsjg. Glad to see you are still soldiering on. Really wish I could say something to you that would make you feel more inspired but I can't. Half the time I am so bewildered and despondent for various reasons that I understand those that dont bother with life far more than those who do. But I will say this, as pointless as this life may seem or perhaps is, IS NOT THE POINT!!! Perhaps the key is to make something of it despite how pointless it may be. Because if none of us bothered to do anything, ever, imagine what an even more vile, f%#ked up, world it would be!!!
Btw, I think you should seriously consider returning to writing in some capacity. It could be your means to survival.

"Glad your extreme work issue has been all but officially sorted. Forgetting anything else, that clearly was going to bring you down! Stress must be one of the main triggers for depression. One thing I would say is don't let one experience stop you doing something - if you enjoyed your job, fight to get back doing it but just a bit more wary/wise to situations than maybe you were before. Don't let one child stop you doing it. However, if it was jsut the final straw, then by all means re-evaluate!
​Glad you're bebinning to see light at the end of the tunnel. Like I've said before, all you need is hope. Not perfection, not an easy life, not miracles, just a realistic hope that you can do what you want. Even if it doesn't come true. Things are over when there is no hope left.
Good luck.

"Thanks again for your sound advice. Still weighing up whether mainstream teaching is really my thing to be honest given that I have also devoted a lifetime to the dance industry prior to this. Also REALLY enjoyed the four years I spent as an HSC/A-Levels English tutor. Perhaps some combination of these things will provide the balance I am seeking. Hmm, might well be time to tune into a bit of fate, or intuition or even The Almightly for some guidance on this matter.
Ok that's it from me. Hope you find a way of returning to your writing and or other interests/skills that you find satisfying. Purpose is incredibly important. In fact I hope everyone here finds that for themselves eventually. Otherwise life is pretty unbearable in my opinion.
Best of Luck!

"I read this, and although not everything is same, I feel exactly the same as you do in some other places.
I'm not a teacher - I haven't got qualifications to do anything skilled, I work in an office, stuck there for about 5 years desperately trying to get a new job but failing everytime. Most of the time I get feedbacks to them and the response is ""you were good, but we just went someone with more experience"" - this make me feel the way you described, that I'm useless or not good enough to do anything.
I know on paper my life isn't bad, the job is decent pay, I have a mortgage on my own flat, I do have some other credit cards and loans to pay back but in 4 years time they will mostly be paid off. I don't feel like I have a good reason to feel this way, I just do and I can't help it. I used to enjoy my job but last few years has been hard, there are few reasons I could think but they are over now, and I don't know why I continue to feel this way.
""I'm not going to be dramatic and say I'm going to end it, it sounds so pathetic (no offence intended to anyone) but I have thoughts of 'going' or even dreams that I could die 'blamelessly' thorugh accident or illness. Selfish I know.""
That I do too, quite frequently and in a strange way, (I don't know about you but I get comforted that if I wanted to end it, I can quite easily by just buying a rope.
"" Relationships, get attracted to ones who need help, help them in anyway I can, get to a point where I feel I am no more use so should go as they'd be ultimately better off.""
Similar with me - though not always get in relationships with them but very close girl mates (who most people around me think we're i a relationship), and they drift away when their problem fades away and/or they get a boyfriend. But I know this is partly my fault because although I think I'm a good listener, I really don't know how to make an effort with people and know what to talk about.
I noticed you are still on here, where is your life now and what is going on at the moment? Curious to see if there was something you did which really helped or would've done since posting this initially.

"I always feel very hypocritical when I write a response on here. It's very much do as I say rather than I do.
The first question I always say is ""what would make you happy?"" it's a very open question but if you can answer it then you've got an aim and you, with the helps of others, can at least work towards that aim and perhaps even enjoy the journey to some degree.
If you can't answer that question then it becomes a hell of a lot more tricky and I doubt I'd be able to talk you through it on here! That's definitely a professional job.
But starting with what you've written you give hints to problems, some which are still on going and other ones you perhaps aren't quite letting yourself forget even if they are in the past. That's perfectly normal, the trick is to get some form of closure to some degree I suppose. I often wish I had no memory!
I do believe you can't say you've failed if you haven't tried because 'I can't/ won't be able to do it'. Not saying that's what you're saying, I just mean overall. I have tried everything people have 'advised' and still failed To be fair, maybe the mindset has guaranteed that, who knows. But to my point, say with work, what job would you want and is it achievable with extra qualifications - I know plenty of people who have returned to education in the later years, utilising after work classes and just working their backsides off to get where they want to be. This might not be applicable to you of course - the experience think is ridiculous catch 22 and the only way I know to get round it is either luck or, if your field of work is suitable, offering your services for free/doing the job with no extra pay until you can leave and take that experience with you - I have been 'acting' in management roles with all the responsibilities and no pay before just to add that to my CV. But this is more careers advice...
Is wanting to die 'blamelessly' selfish? Yes. I can't see how it's not. But I understand and I wish that too. It's absolutely abhorent when you think about it - wishing to be ill when there are thousands of people who just want to be well. I wish I could swap with them but there is no getting away from the fact it's a selfish though. But, largely, isn't depression that? The complete focus on yourself and your inadequecies when you know you should be able to put it in to perspective? I've touched on this in posts before.
Listening in itself is the key to being a good listener, I try to steer away from the very male response to want to fix everything - I've learnt that a lot of women (no sweeping generalisations meant) have preferred the listening element to anything I've had to say! Just an agreeing head, a sympathetic mind, and unjudgemental approach and it can be enough to make people feel better - they get it off their chest. I wouldn't worry too much about talking unless it's a real issue, if you can hold a conversation you're like 75% of the population and just not super chatty like others.
I am still on here and I have broken a little bit with 'convention' in replying when I'm not really 'ready'. By that I mean I'm really not in a good place at all, I haven't been for a few weeks and have been trying to fight it but I can't. It feels like placing a plaster on an amputation at the moment and ever plan feels like a temporary solution to a permanent problem. I have been staying in bed for hours and hours on end just wanting to sleep, half to escape my head and half in the hope I just don't wake up!
So sorry, no I haven't found anything that has helped me but as you correctly point out at the start - we're all different so what might work for one might not work for someone else. My initial impression is you have a vague idea how to reach happiness, you just need help planning the route. Me, I don't think there is that destination any more.

"I guess that's the thing - I don't know what will, so I don't know which direction to take my first steps. I have a good idea of ""an environment"" of a job I would like to be in, but I don't know what job/career would put me in that environment.
Yeah, I'm going to keep trying for new jobs, I got an interview on Thursday, I think what made it difficult was tat the feedbacks didn't suggest anyway I could've improved. But I guess 1 day i got to come out on top.
Definitely, some jobs you just fall into - which I kind of have with my current role actually, and I am very fortunate to be in this position compared to most people - and you are able to build on that. The problem I have with my job is that the experience I get in my current; role is not easily available in another place, or progression is limited from it.
It is selfish definitely, you're only thinking about yourself not the others around you, although I would hate to accuse anyone who was pushed to the point they saw no other option in their life other than to do so. Relating to the ""listening"" part, Few years ago I was talking a lot with a friend where a family member had just commited suicide. I was listening a lot, about the family, situation before and after, the letter that was left behind etc etc, but I started to think too much about the person who had commited suicide, the life they had and the process where they got to that point, and with this coming at the same time when there was a breakdown of a relationship with people at work, I got really depressed. I would burst into tears on my break or in the toilets, didn't sleep for days and although it never managed to get to the point where I attempted suicide (Thanks to handful of close friends) I lost all energy and motivation for a long time.
Why ae you not in a good place at the moment? The same situation as to what you described initially?
Thank you for the swift reply

"Sorry for the slight delay replying.
Maybe, and everything is only an uneducated suggestion, you would be wise to compartmentalise for a little bit. With work you need to get some proper career advice, there are plenty of places to find it I'm sure. Get the knowledge you need to know where you need to be and what you need to do to be in the environment you want to be in. Once you've got that, you'll have a better grip on where you're heading work wise.
Then, turning to the 'head' side of things, you will be able to separate the work stuff from the 'you' stuff. I think it's never a bad plan to focus on something else rather than your own thinking anyway! If you get your work stuff sorted you may find you feel better overall, you often don't notice how much one thing can impact on you until it's no longer there. If you still feel bad though, maybe it will highlight what is really the issue that had been masked before to some degree. You've got something to focus on - your job/ career - so do that, put other stuff on the back burner and then return to it if you need to. Although assuming again, you seem relatively confident in what you do, it almost isn't challenging enough.
I always feel the truth is one of the hardest elements. I don't think I can ever say committing suicide isn't selfish. It is, but that doesn't mean it's not understandable. I have got to that point, I'm sure I will again. I accept that means I'm selfish. I hope that doesn't make me a bad person. In the same way if someone is bad at their job and gets sacked - it doesn't make them a bad person it just means they weren't made for that job. Failure doesn't equal bad. And being selfish doesn't equal being horrible. I think it's an emotive word, but selfishness is sometimes a good quality to have - in fact some may advocate it from time to time to help you get straight. It's all about getting balance.
You sound like you took it to heart when you helped your friend and that shows a strong empathy you have. It may have triggered little issues you have yourself. I know a lot of therapists have therapists to help them deal with the issues they've heard. Just because you didn't know the person, their death can still hit you. Look at the out pouring of grief over the loss of life of that refugee child. You sound like you were traumatised to some degree and maybe you need to speak to someone about that. It can be particularly bad if things strike a chord with you. As for crying at everything, I completely understand.... In fact that's all I'll say. The key thing to focus on is you have a handful of friends to help you when you feel low, try to value and maintain that. I half wonder if the point I became beyond help was when I lost all mine; I pushed the away, I'd always been up and down but them finally going was probably not the best thing for me.
You sound like you've come through the worst of it to some degree, keep fighting upwards. There will always be triggers or issues that pick at our individual insecurities but the key is to find you own methods of controlling that. I think the focus on life and death is perhaps to be avoided at all costs, especially when low, as it is never a cheerful thought.
As for your last question, if you don't mind, I'm not going to answer. There is no rhyme or reason sometimes, but unfortunately I, either through life, luck or through me creating self fulfilling prophecies, am always right about my own beliefs and the facts that can not be refuted. I only ever see evidence for it. By whatever yard the measure is, it is not good. And that's cryptic enough...!
Good luck with your interview on Thursday!

"That's ok, think this site was having a maintenance anyway.
""you seem relatively confident in what you do, it almost isn't challenging enough.""
Spot on - and the thing is, the way the company is heading, I won't be doing that for much longer when they outsource my job to an external party and I will be put in my previous role which I worked hard to get out of and will be a major step down. This is definitely adding to the pressure and the feeling of walking towards... not my ""end"" but giving me a pessimistic outlook for the near future.
I just need that courage to quit - since my last post on here, I've heard that this interview I got tomorrow they have people lined up for already, and it's unlikely that I will get it. So scared to quite a job without a back up plan, I don't have parents or a partner who could financially support me and I do have a mortgage to pay (although it's probably cheaper than most rents for a similar kind of property).
True... I seem to drag work into my personal life and I don't want to, it might not help that, in an opposite way, although I haven't fallen out with people I work with as such, I don't have anyone at work that's on the same wave length like I used to when I enjoyed it to get me through the tough times at work.
No I don't think it's a bad thing either - I just don't seem to use that selfish-ness at the right moments to make my self happy. It was a bit strange when I was listening to the troubles I took it so to the heart. The person who had taken their life basically had a promising sports career where they belonged to a major sports group at a young age which was their dream, but through a serious injury then age they had to give up that dream which lead to their end. It's NOTHING like my life but I think I looked in too mcuh about what their thought process was when I was listening, piecing different parts of information together to provide an answer to how it came to this. I think I am over this incident itself, but I think the breakdown of relationships and my mind itself from it is the serious issue.
I worry about losing them too... and I lost a few after that incident. but maybe they were not THAT close to me in the first place. I don't know. I try to look at it from a third person's view about that situation back then, and I know I didn't act ""perfectly"" but I know why I was in a state where I could not act (or feel like I could act) in that way. Most of those who left made me feel guilty for being depressed. One of those who has stuck around is now got a depression now, and I hope I can be there for him like he was for me, and make sure not to act like those who made me feel isolated and alone.
That's ok, I have no intention of forcing it out of you. Although maybe you need to find a way to change your surroundings, friends, work, lover etc etc. I know it takes courage to do so because I'm not doing it at the moment! I did find making a list of things you want to live for (or a ""list of reasons to stay alive"") helped me become positive a bit... not just like ""holiday/visiting another country"" but even if it's like ""watching the next episode of a TV Series"" or a ""New game that's coming out"", I found that I only really had handful of reasons I felt negative about, with a lot more things to look forward to. Just that the things I feel negative about were the most difficult/awkward things to change!
Thank you anyway, I've applied for different roles in external companies now, and few recruitment agencies do want to speak to me (not that they ever lead to much in the past), maybe I should give my self a push and resign if I don't get through this interview (which is for an internal role).
I hope you do pull through, and find a new reason to be positive, whatever form that would take.

"I'll keep the career talk to a minimum as I think there are probably better places you can get advice on that, either generic or for your specific line of work. What I would say is, unfortunately, you're right not to quit a job without something lined up. I know we watch these 'follow your dreams' movies but in reality you'll still have stuff to pay for and the longer you're out of work the harder it is to explain on a CV as they ask for the reasons behind the gaps and, as much as it isn't, it always just sounds like ""I could'nt be bothered to stick at a job I dislike"". The trick will be finding a way of enhancing your chances of getting to where you want to be through postition, interview, qulaifications or what ever other trick someone more knowledgeable than me will advice. As for not blurring the lines between work and home then you'd be a robot if you could manage it completely!
As for the person who commited suicide, you do not have to be anything like them to feel as if parts apply to you - they sounded like they had a plan and then didn't know how to acheive it when life threw a spanner in the works. Sounds a little like you. As I said, this is more professional advice that is needed and getting a doctor to refer you to a psychologist may help, it may only take a few sessions - if desperate you can even book your own for relatively little per session. Don't underestimate how things can effect you even if they don't seem that related. Robin Williams death greatly effected me despite me not being a world famous comedian with millions in the bank or being a performer and life of the party. It was the element of putting on a public front and then eventually 'it' still getting you. It can be tenuous but lots of things might have struck a chord with you.
To friends. It's a tricky one, on one hand if they did disappear then maybe they weren't good friends, on the other maybe I pushed them so hard they couldn't stay. Furthermore, maybe fear keeps them away - very few people really understand mental health issues, even if you do try to explain it to them. Hard when you can't explain it to yourself! Actually I never really told my friends I had issues, I just pushed them away and they didn't really fight. The one who knew more than others I simply think didn't understand or value the issues. I think ultimately people just gave up! I'm stubborn. Maybe I tested them to some degree too which wasn't fair, when they didn't repsond in the way I hope - everyone lost. I think what you're doing for your current friend will work because you know the thought processes, you know not to say 'just smile' or really irritating things like 'it'll all work out in the end'.... grrr, personal worst sentence you can say!
It doesn't take courage to change your life, often it takes fear. I normally change my life in a response to the 'fight or flight' response. I have changed everything about my life due to 'this', always with the intention of moving on to better things. But it doesn't work - sometimes you need to not change things and face the issues, otherwise you're just talking them to a new place and starting the same probelms from scratch until you reach the same place all over again. I have moved a fair bit, I have lost old friends and replaced them with new friends who I have now lost again. I have changed jobs to escape bad things and ended up being in exactly the same situation again in each one. I have left lovers because I feared they would be better off without me. I always change, but other than being proven right about my issues that doesn't always help! Sometimes I think it's braver to admit that it isn't because x,y and z keeps happening - it's simply because I am the problem.
The list thing is a VERY dangerous plan ha ha. In the few visits to my therapist he suggested something along those lines and thinking about it makes me feel a hundred times worse! I actually can't think of anything that I want to stay alive for, eventually you're going to miss something even if you live to 100! Nothing greatly inspires me, the few things that might (like travel) are too expensive and make me realise how much of a drain on my partner I am. In fact every dream I had is now a nightmare as the reality is they are impossible and even the most positive of person admits that with me. I am plagued by logic and unfortunately, it's rarely disputable. Doesn't matter how much you dream it or want it, you're not going to be the first 75 year old footballer! Reality sometimes gets in the way.
So when you get to the point that all your dreams and hopes are unacheivable you die a little. Whe you start realising all the dreams and hopes of those around you are being killed my you too, then maybe that's the time I decide to leave. Anyway....
I hope your interview went well today, although I get the impression it won't have due to them lining up others. If it does fall through I strongly recommend you don't quit but speak to a a professional careers advisor (I believe they;re available at places like Job Centre? or online) and work out how to get where you want to be.
I get a strong feeling that when you're happy in work you'll find that impacts far more on the rest of your life than you realise and everything will begin to feel more manageable or you'll be able to focus on sorting them out without also worrying about work. Good luck.

"Yeah I think I am going to different recruiters at the moment and with the ones I've already tried, they've been generally helpful in the past (I guess they want commission at the end of the day). The idea of quitting has become stronger as quite a number of people in the company have quitted , been sacked or made redundant recently, they've gone to do different things, new jobs, travelling etc. or just a break and I guess that idea of leaving, it just comes in my head more.
No course not - I remember I was upset in a similar way when I once read an article of a couple who suicided and I started thinking about the reasons they did (I won't go into it as it is depressing and sad) when I was reading the article. I assume with when Robin Williams passed away it was because he was a big figure when you were growing up? Or maybe the due to the characters he represented?
I know what you mean, I do feel with those that left me I was partly to blame, but at the same time they were really not the people I wanted to be around with. Say if I was able to go back in time, I COULD'VE gone to the doctors or something to take some time off work to get away from work environment, and maybe spoke to those friends back then outside in private. That most likely would've kept the friendship but then again, I think my career and work would've been affected negatively. Oh god I hate those comments!
""'just smile' or really irritating things like 'it'll all work out in the end'""
THAT, is one of the worst things you could say to a person. I had something along those lines... ""If you keep working you will get out of it"" or something like that. Asking someone who's very close to completely losing the will to carry on to find some strength from nowhere is a very harsh thing to say, it’s like pushing someone who’s standing on a cliff edge.
I remember one of the “friends” was upset because I didn’t tell them the issues I was having, and that they heard from another person who had… “I’m very upset that you didn’t talk to me about this”, but didn’t touch the actual subject of why I was feeling down, I just remember thinking “do you actually care about anyone but yourself???”. Maybe I’m just being bitter.
I guess that’s the difference… are you doing something because you want to do it, or because you don’t want to be where you are at the moment? When you go from one job to the other, is it similar kind of job? Does the job itself not suit your personality? Like I know I never would be a salesman. I’m so much better at handling complaints (probably due to my listening habits) than being a pushy salesman, last time I changed jobs it was because my old job started to become sales focused. Haha at least you find a lover, you must have a fairly decent level of attraction, I haven’t been in a proper relationship… the closest one was when they cheated on their partner with me, and that sort of scenario has happened with me quite a few times. This seems to stem from the listening thing as well, troubled relationship, the opposite sex who will listen to them and then get with me.
Ok, don’t make a list haha. But just to give you an idea, when I made mine, the bad was just the “Work” and “Family”(Or “Parents” specifically), and for the good I listed all the TV shows, movies, places I want to go and see at some point in my life, restaurants or food I like eating, sports team I support and even unrealistic things like a Lamborghini (though I could probably go on those test drive things one day). When you talk about the logic – is it the age thing? So you can’t do something because you’re too old? I’m obviously not gonna say something stupid like “you shouldn’t give up”, somethings you just can’t do. Like that family member of a friend who killed himself, by the time he was back to full fitness from a serious injury he was over what the general idea of “peak age” of a sportsman’s career, and (from what I can make out) he was just not the talented promising star that he once was.
Thank you, the interviewers and I were pretty engaged in conversation but I don’t think I answered the questions as effectively as well as I had hoped. Not end of the world, just because a team of people concluded that I wasn’t good enough for that role it doesn’t mean there’s no one out there that is better for me. Job Centre is probably a good idea though, at least I can get an idea of steps to take. Already applied for external jobs just need to hear back.
Yeah I never been the type to work for long term plans, I know people say you should have a target etc. but if I can’t see a relatively instant result I don’t have the motivation. I did struggle at school because of this, because I couldn’t understand why what I was studying was relevant to my life. But when I went into a job and learned something new, I would pick it up so much quicker than those around me. I don’t know what it is… maybe I’m just a lazy person haha.
If you do want to talk about your current state, just say. I'm happy to listen.

"Hey just a note to say I hope the job thing has become clearer over the last few days and that I had read the message, I just had brain freeze and didn't know what to write - I kind of still have it. Definitely can tell when very low as my mind shuts down, my spelling and grammar become appalling and I can't be bothered to re-read and edit!
​You sound clearer though, even over a few days which is briliant. I firmly believe all that is needed for most people is a plan and hope. People don't want everything to be perfect, they just want hope that is could be. Take that confidence you have in your abilities and let that be your focus for now, get the job sorted and then come back on here if and when you still feel you need support.
​That's not to say you're not welcome!! I just don't think it's healthy necessarily to focus on how you feel... that kind of makes no sense! I mean you need to look outward as focusing on yourself (certainly does for me) makes me feel worse and it's almost better to just live life rather than do ANY thinking!! I hope that makes sense!
​Good luck.

"I'm not even sure I have depression, I think this may just be 'me'.
I have always been pretty useless socially, but have had a normal upbringing, no horrible experiences, have gone through education fine and even got jobs but I've never enjoyed life, never really cared and normally feel like I'm not really worth anything and, inevitably enventually, will become a burden.
I'm not going to be dramatic and say I'm going to end it, it sounds so pathetic (no offence intended to anyone) but I have thoughts of 'going' or even dreams that I could die 'blamelessly' thorugh accident or illness. Selfish I know.
I have a cycle. Get job, put on confident easy going persona, get physically tired from doing that, lose energy to maintain job, focus on negative, leave job in some form (fired/quit). Friends are much the same, play easy going fun, can't keep it up, lose or push them away. Relationships, get attracted to ones who need help, help them in anyway I can, get to a point where I feel I am no more use so should go as they'd be ultimately better off.
So, currently I've quit my job as a teacher, couldn't take it - always something to improve and with my way of thinking that just sounds like constantly someone telling you you're useless (and it backing up your own thoughts anyway) but even though I liked aspects of my job I don't think I had a passion like I see in others. I felt I'd let everyone down so disappeared, my partner/ parents got me through immediate days after my sudden departure from work and saw Doc who was nice enough - put me on medication which seemed to do very little - even after a few months. In fact it only had negative side effects so about three weeks ago I stopped taking them completely. I also started seeing a CBT person about three/four session ago but this feels like it's doing nothing at all either, we talk, I'm honest as I can be but there is some element of being 'public' and putting on that face/ jokey responses.
I dip between a wish to not be around that is forever there and seems to be backed up with wholly logical reasons that people genuinely struggle to refute to absolutely crashing panic attacks/ given up when my 'theories' are proved.
I know this sounds odd, but I don't even have the will to get 'better', largely because I don't think I can. I am just 'me'. I am negative, boring and even if it is all just selffullfillng profecies - it's still me who has done that. I'm not blaming life, or others or anything else.
A lot of the posts I read on here seem to have good reason; PTS, loss, finances etc - does anyone have no 'good' reason?
I just feel I'm never going to be happy, I am soon to be much a burden on those around me (my gf) and that, in the long run, it'd be better for all if I just went. I know my family and gf love me - but time heals, life would get better and people move on. In the long run I'm sure it wouldn't effect my family and 100% sure my gf would be better off.
Not sure if there is an answer for this, just writing. I'm not angry, I'm not hurt, I'm not even sad as such, I'm just tired...

"Hi rsjg,
I've read your post a few times when depressed and Googling. All I can say is that there are many people out there who feel the same as you do. Not all of them jump online and say as much, though. I won't say that life ""gets better"", but I will say that emotions are temporary. Even if you feel very bad right now, there will be times when you feel better, even if it's just temporary.

"Thank you for your message. I do realise that feelings/emotions/depression has its ups and downs but my main issue is my 'peaks' are still bad - at my best I am just a little down or lack enthusiasm, during my dips it's perhaps more 'critical'. I worry that if those 'peaks' are it then there really is little point. I hope you find better periods of happiness than I do!

"Hi, thanks for writing in the thread.
​Although I am very guilty of not doing this myself (although I have tried and it's still not great!) I always think it's a good start to focus on those things that are good and not the negatives. I've said before, hope is more important than success - not saying you or anyone else have reasons for hope as that's impossible to say to a stranger, but that if you as an individual can find it then great.
​You're young, that's definitely a plus. I do feel the quicker things are addressed the better so proactively take steps now to deal with it rather than waste 10-20 years wondering what if. Social awkwardness is understandable (trust me I'm nearly an expert!) but not unsolveable even in small amounts - especially when you are so young - the change from 21 to 30 is probably close to the change from 12 to 21. the fact you're even writing on these boards at such an age shows you have a good idea something isn't 'right'.
​As for the positives, you say you ENJOY your job. Hell, you have and seem to be able to hold it. Three positives there in itself. Many friends is still some friends - don't focus on who's missing, have great fun with those you do have. Despite what social media would imply, most people only have two or three close friends and everyone else is an aquaintance - they might be overtly friendly and chatty but they wouldn't share or trust anything with them.
​So do you know what it is that makes you feel as you do? Have you seen a doctir yet? That should always be your first port of call - it is rarely a quick fix but some of these feelings (and sick and tired springs out) can be attributed to things that CAUSE depression and not from the EFFECT and may be solveable by increasing iron or another vitamin deficiency. If the Doctor then says you're fine, they may point you in more useful directions if it's a mental health problem. Just check physical before writing it off.
​If you knwo more exactly what makes you unhappy then is there anyway to resolve it? Can you create a hope through actions - not solve it immediately but foresee a time when it will be.
​Being quiet, reclusive or shy is not a bad thing. We are led to believe it is in this society and the confident extroverts will inevitably rise to the top (sometimes without merit) but it takes all sorts to keep things ticking and you are going to be much more suitable for some people (work and relationships) than those who display things you 'lack'. I'd always trust the quiet truth talking thinker over the extroverted quick chatting b*ll person!!
​I never mark grammar on a forum. It's for chatting, not education or essays and anyone who does is a bit sad... so I often mark them in retaliation!
​Good luck with what ever step you make next. All I would request is you make a step, choose an avenue to investigate and try it. If you get to the end of the journey and still feel as you do, come back - I'll know exactly where you stand...

"Hey thanks for replying, probably the feeling of being different is what gets too me always feeling i need to impress people and the feeling i am always being judged i was judged alot when i was in school due to my ADD and never feel it has left me even though i no longer rely on medication , feel asthough i have too try 10 times harder than everyone else to get too where i am or want too be and it just wears me out. I always feel like im the one thats just there not really wanted or needed always given the cold shoulder and just mess everything up.
I have read a few forums on ADD running through to adulthood and a few of my problems do relate to what they say and can increase risks of depression not sure if this matters or if im over exagerating,i rang samaritans a few months ago but just couldent find the confidance to tell them my problems so i hung up,so not sure if i could do it face to face(with a doctor)
Thanks for taking time to reply

"I don't know enough about ADD in adults but you seem to have already discovered there is probably a link between how you feel and ADD so, for me, surely that's something to investigate.
Seeing a Doctor or speaking to the Samaritans is tricky, I understand that but if you can go in with an idea that it might be linked to ADD then you may find a chat with a doctor actually relevantly concise and fruitful.
If I was at a point where possibly restarting some medication I've been on before could make me feel ten times better and I just needed a chat with my Doctor I'd do it. Going in and asking for help when you don't know what's wrong at all is scary or feels pointless but I think you know it might actually get results.
Sort out the easier stuff first. You may find it helps stuff you weren't even aware of.
Sorry if this reply is badly written or formatted, I'm on my tablet and it's messed everything up.

"I'm not sure I would say death was interesting. For me, death is nothing, no thoughts, no peace but just complete nothing. I'm not going to be able to be pleased or regret being dead, I will not know anything from the moment my last breath leaves me and whatever happens to those I care about I will not be able to be happy or sad about. That's death. An ever lasting dreamless sleep.
It may still be preferable to a living state where there is no happiness. Furthermore I've often argued/ thought that my death may have more positive ramifications than negative ones but I'll never know for sure.
You need to work out what it is that makes you feel like you do. Is it physical or mental exhaustion? What bores you? Does anything excite you or give you hope? What is the barrier to you being happy?
I don't think all barriers can be removed but I think you need to identify them as best you can before you give up.
Good luck.

I know i might sound crazy for saying that death seems interesting but it really does... i don't know if interesting is the correct word, its more like being alive is so troublesome... why be bothered when you can just not exist at all, it will be so much peaceful.
Most of the time I just I wasn't born, then there be no problem to begin with.
Well really thanks for listening to me and i don't think i'm going to up so soon.

"I just happened to be checking my emails as this came through - so your timing is good!
​It's so hard not to sound chocolate boxy when trying to give advice to situations and people you know only through a few sentences. However I have to try!
What do you really look forward to? Like always, I'm not saying answer that on here but ask yourself. Why isn't it happening? Is there anything you can do to help it happen? Do you need to do something to create a change or push yourself out your comfort zone? If you've tried and couldn't do it, or failed for a multitude of other reasons then I can completely empathise. If you can't even try is there a reason there that you could approach? Sometimes dealing with the inability to try might help you get the thing you actually want. If that makes sense! Nothing happens without action from somebody though, it's nice if others provide it but you can only guarantee it if you do it.
​As for death you're kind of right, although we're not supposed to admit it. We weren't alive before and we will be dead one day and the world will keep on turning and billions of people around the world won'y even know. But it won't be peaceful, it won't be anything. Don't think of death as being anything, anyone who imagines what life is like after they're gone is missing the point - there is no imagining, no peace, nothing. Focus on the living and how you can make that better. That doesn't mean I don't understand, empathise and even agree with you that life isn't worth living but you have to quantify that with what your life is like now, if it really is awful and makes you cry everyday and there is no hope then I understand the wish to depart, but it is only as a means on ending the pain it does not bring happiness or relief or peace - it brings nothing. The question is, is nothing better than living? I'm not going to try and answer that with such limited information - what I will say is I believe in euthanasia for those with incurable pain (much like the mind?) but also believe those that can be cured should not take that route. Can you be cured? Can I?!
​You need to speak to someone a lot more qualified than me. You need to make sure all the basics are ticked off; are you physically lacking in certain areas which is causing depression/ tiredness, are you suffering from some form of trauma, have you got an issue from which everything stems from? Once you've ruled out all these then I think it makes decisions and thought processes clearer. Lile a medical diagnosis - make sure it's not the simple stuff and then see where you go from there.
​People on here will always listen. If life is boring, do one thing next year that you think might be exciting and see if that changes anything. Move area, get a new job, go on a brave backpacking holiday, do something that isn't 'you' - then see how you feel. Or, maybe more sensibly, just speak to someone and see what comes out.
Good luck.

"Another one for the 'signed up just to reply club. Given that some days In struggled to raise a tut towards the Katie Hopkins column in the Daily Mail I would ask you to recognise the gravity of this.
As it goes I don't much to say. I stumbled on this the way many others have: Why am I so rubbish. Why am I tired of life. Everything is generally pants and I'm not sure I care enough to do anything about it.
I have some form very similar to yours but that's not the purpose of the post.
Just wanted to say I very much like the style of your writing. Not sure what you can do with that. I was going to suggest becoming an author. I saw the whole JK Rowling thing happening for you. Then I read the not a fan of rejection bit which probably scuppers that.
But for what it's worth I would definitely read at least half your book before my natural ability to not be bothered about anything kicked in.
And you can put that on the back of your first novel.

"Thanks for your reply. I must admit it both surprises, yet depresses, me that people still find this thread and have similar feelings to me. I wish there was some conclusion - it's only head stuff that isn't 'fixed'; depression, addiction, trauma are always there but you can recover from a broken leg!
​I very much recognise your opening paragraphs and it brings another word to my mind; dispair. You (I) despair at yourself but also the world around you, that mean immoral people prosper whilst the good suffer. The likes Of Katie Hopkins, or even Lady C on I'm a Celeb, are celebrated for their awfulness whilst others are ignored for their calm caring nature. Bu that's a whole different rant.
​Writing is often something people put to me, my parents in early days, my short career in journalism and then now - even if it's just rewriting CVs and covering letters people seem to like my 'flow'. But flow is only one aspect of writing and I don't really possess the creativity, wit or belief to be able to write my own stuff. I've tried, often a few chapters are written before I decide it's rubbish and delete it all!! Thank you for suggesting it though.
​I've tried to move away from my thoughts on these boards and use it only for reference if it can help others who post in this thread. With that in mind, and based on the limited information you've given, I hope you try some of things that have been mentioned in previous posts. There is a difference between being bothered or having the energy to do something and always think a lack of physical energy should be investigated as that can often increase any depressive tendencies.
​The 'why am I so rubbish' statement is a very tricky one. I'm not going to be one of those people who tell you you're not - I don't know you. Saying as much would be just a worthless statement and mean nothing. What I would say is you need, not necessarily on here, to say why you feel that way, how could that view be changed? I have this unfortunate habit of backing up my view of myself (negative) with facts that even outsiders can't refute. But I'm fairly good at seeing the positives in others and will always try to be helpful and constructive - I generally view most people who are wise enough to know they know nothing to have something going for them!
​Good luck with whatever you decide to do next.

"Hi, I can understand what you're saying as I have felt the same throughout my life. There is a particular personal issue which triggers off bouts of depression but I can honestly say that I have hardly had any happiness in my 55 years. Now I doubt I ever will find what I've always been searching for so I either have to learn to accept that and live with it, or else.............
What You have described certainly sounds like a form of depression and I would encourage you to seek professional help; ignoring how you feel may be ok for a while but long term you could find yourself feeling worse and/or unable to cope on a day to day basis.
I Would like to wish you well in whatever you decide to do, but do try to take care of yourself

"Thank you for your message. I'm not going to delve as I'm sure you would have said if you wanted to, but the 'one issue' that can be a trigger is, as I'm sure you're aware, the key to you finding happiness. Taking away that one thing may make everything else easier to deal with. However, if it is truly impossible to deal with that one issue then I can only feel for you. 55 is not old now though, people are already hitting 100 with relative regularity so you could even argue you're middle aged!
I strongly believe you're never too old to do something, you may be physically unable the older you get but anything else is just the mind. I've seen, and even known, people pass driving tests, learn a new language, get married or go on a wild holiday at way older than 55! The mind can put barriers in the way but what's the worst that can happen? I also think that with a creative mind even the unachievable can be achieved, even if it won't be quite as perfect as it was in your mind.
​I have sought some help. I tried medication with no luck and I tried the talk therapy route with arguably even less (he tried using religion and it was never going to get anywhere). I often find myself unable to cope and reguarly know I respond badly to even mildly bad news, constant 'straws that broke the camel's back'. It can feel personal even if it isn't - case in point this week my shed was broken in to and my bike stolen. It was the first time in seven years I'd let my insurance lapse (for two weeks) so I took that badly, like I was cursed. Never been broken in to before so why now? Further more I blamed myself, I felt I'd let people down by not doing my job - securing the property adequately or ensuring the insurance was up to date. The fact they only took my bike and not others was good I suppose, but then it felt even more personal! I know it's a ridiculous over-reaction and in a year I will probably barely remember it but I'd be lying if 'thoughts' didn't cross my mind. I have/had enough.
​I think I've found a place where I'm kind of in limbo at the moment. Teetering on the brink of giving up. If I'm honest I doubt I'll make 55, I'm always a little surprised to make the next one and birthday's in themselves are often a trigger. When the base is so low, even the smallest knock makes you fall. One thing keeps me going, despite also being a reason to go, but it's a dangerous place to be.
​I am tired of my situation but still think it's mostly of my own making. When the film has been awful for the first 80 minutes, I very much doubt the last ten minutes will suddenly turn it all round and make it worth it - worse still is if you make someone else sit through it with you.
​But probably getting a little dark! I hope you haven't given up and look at things that help you achieve what you want whether that be love, life or success but if I re-read you're opening paragraph you say 'hardly any' - focus on that as 'some'.
​Best wishes.

"Hello again thanks for your message, I'm sorry to hear about your bike being stolen - isn't that Sod's law, just at the time you had forgotten to renew your insurance. Try not to blame yourself for the insurance lapse, it's annoying but you didn't do it on purpose. I know from experience that when we are suffering from depression, we are quick to blame ourselves when things go wrong - even things beyond our control. I'm also sorry to hear that your experience of therapy didn't go well - should a therapist be using religion to help a patient? I would think that is a no no, so maybe you just had the misfortune to be paired up with the wrong therapist. I have had 2 separate bouts of NHS counselling this year, and I am now paying to see another privately because I need somewhere to go where I can talk openly and feel comfortable. Perhaps you could think about referring yourself tomIAPT (you can do this without having to go through your GP) (check online for details www.IAPT.nhs.uk). This may be a good way to start trying to get some help.
Your final sentence has a ring of truth to it - I was happy for 6 months in 1984! Beyond that, my life has been miserable and I am regularly just on autopilot getting through each day. My ""issue"" is probably one that millions of other people have, but I have let it take me over and ruin my life. I have always wanted to find love & settle down with that special person. Thought I'd found it once, but it wasn't meant to be. Kept searching, getting hurt and demoralised until 17 years ago I made the decision to give up looking and accept that I was meant to be alone. The years passed me by until this time last year I realised that I had fallen in love with someone; it hurts to be with them and hurts to be apart from them, someone who I have thought about every single day, someone who I have shed tears over but ultimately someone who I can't tell how I feel; the most unsuitable person I could have chosen to fall in love with.
Please look after yourself, keep in touch here to let us know how you are doing. Best wishes

"Hello and thanks for your message. Sorry to hear that you too have problems which have impacted on your life and greatly contribute towards your depression. I think what you wrote could have been word for word written by me, such is the similarity.
i hope that it isn't too late for you to find that thing you have been looking for, but you say you have given up. Same here (see my reply to rsjg above), which as you say leads to more depression. We live with it because we know we have to but the pain is always there. We hide our true self from others, so that they don't see or know about the sadness and turmoil we are carrying around with us. Most people I meet daily don't have a clue that the person they see and talk to is just an outer shell hiding the real me inside.
please take care of yourself, keep in touch here for support x

"I know the bike isn't my fault, or even that big a deal in the grand scheme of things, but like you wisely stated - it's just another little thing to have a go at myself for. I almost see it as being either I'm stupid or I'm unlucky, constantly people recognise I find myself in negative situations so there really is only one of two options and neither of them make me feel any better!
​Yes, the talk therapy evolved in to more of a theological debate, largely stemming from my insistence I saw no 'point' and him saying it was impossible without faith. I also know he found the sessions almost fun as he 'enjoyed sparring with me' but I think he kind of acknowledged he wasn't gettting anywhere. I don't want to see the Doctor again (he has a proper job to do!) and even more strangely I don't want to be refered back to the same clinic where all the therapists are as I'd feel worried/ even guilty about telling him I didn't think it was working and then asking for anyone but him. I know he wouldn't care but I'd feel anxious about upsetting him! Weird I know. I can't afford private at the moment, I already feel enough of a drain.
​Love is such a tricky one and I certainly can not speak from any authority. I maintain it's never 'too late' but am not stupid enough to say 'oh it'll all work out in the end'. In this day and age it also doesn't take much to meet new people if you can face it - we would never be having this conversation if it wasn't for the internet! But, without proclaiming any intelligence on the matter, I always say to single people (of all ages) that meeting people does NOT have to be a romantic thing. Say you're on one of the dating sites and after communications you decide to meet. Why go with any expectations other than to have a new friend? This isn't directly aimed at you but an overall point. Meeting people for people makes meeting partners easier - going out looking for a partner is impossible. I have only ever dated women I have been friends with first, I assumed they weren't interested and got to know them as people!
​However, I may have wandered off your message. You have someone you like - how impossible is it? These are not questions I would expect you to answer, just to think about. If you did declare your love what would be the worst case scenario? Although a bit greeting card message - it really is impossible to be happy unless you risk everything for it. However, I also recognise that is all well and good in the movies, in real life not so much. If they're happily married, or 'inappropriate' in any way then the next step is not to look for love - but to fall out of love. You need to have a clean break, with absence and time people can fall out of love, or recognise it as an old love. People who are widowed don't love their lost partners any less, they just move on and find a different love with someone else. Does that make sense or am I being insulting in some way?! Like I said, I know not of what I talk about!! A slight aside; watch 'First Dates' on Ch4, it is entertaining anyway but there have been lots of older people (in to 70's and 80's) and they still enjoy life.
​What is a partner? It's a best friend you sleep wth if you cut it down to the crude essentials. Finding a best friend is trickier than finding a random person to sleep with. But friends are a lot easier to find than partners... so, for me, finding a friend means everything is possible. Finding a partner is an impossible task to aim for. Find more friends, be more sociable, see new people. Don't look for a partner, look for friends. Partners can't become friends, friends can become partners. And now I've finished this vomit enducing sappy/movie like statement I will counter it with the full acknowledgement that is far easier said than done. I struggle meeting friends, in fact I have none now, so I know some elements of what I say is just fantasy. However, I always think looking for a partner never works, it just evolves from something completely unrelated.
​Sorry, I've probably not answered your message very well at all and most of what I've written doesn't apply to you. But if you take one thing from the rubbish I've written; it's never too late for anything, but it's also never guaranteed.
Good luck.

"Hi Whatamess. Like I said I have a great sadness but have largely dealt with it. It is worse at Christmas because I feel even more alone then. But many others do too. I am happier giving up hope of it because I don't dwell on it so much anymore.
I don't hide my true self from others at all and have talked a bit about it with good friends, as they have talked about their innermost feelings with me. It's a 2 way thing. Of course we all have to put a face on a bit with day to day people we are not close to ie at work but that's life. You can still be you.
I have many aspects to my personality so I tend to show that side of me instead. Maybe it's an age thing as I am 61 now. Never be ashamed of what and who you are but be very choosy who you show your real self to.
I hope you find what you are looking for. x

"I'm not even sure I have depression, I think this may just be 'me'.
I have always been pretty useless socially, but have had a normal upbringing, no horrible experiences, have gone through education fine and even got jobs but I've never enjoyed life, never really cared and normally feel like I'm not really worth anything and, inevitably enventually, will become a burden.
I'm not going to be dramatic and say I'm going to end it, it sounds so pathetic (no offence intended to anyone) but I have thoughts of 'going' or even dreams that I could die 'blamelessly' thorugh accident or illness. Selfish I know.
I have a cycle. Get job, put on confident easy going persona, get physically tired from doing that, lose energy to maintain job, focus on negative, leave job in some form (fired/quit). Friends are much the same, play easy going fun, can't keep it up, lose or push them away. Relationships, get attracted to ones who need help, help them in anyway I can, get to a point where I feel I am no more use so should go as they'd be ultimately better off.
So, currently I've quit my job as a teacher, couldn't take it - always something to improve and with my way of thinking that just sounds like constantly someone telling you you're useless (and it backing up your own thoughts anyway) but even though I liked aspects of my job I don't think I had a passion like I see in others. I felt I'd let everyone down so disappeared, my partner/ parents got me through immediate days after my sudden departure from work and saw Doc who was nice enough - put me on medication which seemed to do very little - even after a few months. In fact it only had negative side effects so about three weeks ago I stopped taking them completely. I also started seeing a CBT person about three/four session ago but this feels like it's doing nothing at all either, we talk, I'm honest as I can be but there is some element of being 'public' and putting on that face/ jokey responses.
I dip between a wish to not be around that is forever there and seems to be backed up with wholly logical reasons that people genuinely struggle to refute to absolutely crashing panic attacks/ given up when my 'theories' are proved.
I know this sounds odd, but I don't even have the will to get 'better', largely because I don't think I can. I am just 'me'. I am negative, boring and even if it is all just selffullfillng profecies - it's still me who has done that. I'm not blaming life, or others or anything else.
A lot of the posts I read on here seem to have good reason; PTS, loss, finances etc - does anyone have no 'good' reason?
I just feel I'm never going to be happy, I am soon to be much a burden on those around me (my gf) and that, in the long run, it'd be better for all if I just went. I know my family and gf love me - but time heals, life would get better and people move on. In the long run I'm sure it wouldn't effect my family and 100% sure my gf would be better off.
Not sure if there is an answer for this, just writing. I'm not angry, I'm not hurt, I'm not even sad as such, I'm just tired...

"Thanks again for your message - I didn't realise that you actually started this thread a year ago - shows how much attention I pay sometimes. anyway you do seem to have had a lot of responses, which I hope in some way have helped you.
Re my problems which I mentioned in my last message - the looking for love is not quite as straightforward as I made it sound. Plus the person I have fallen in love with would definitely be viewed as ""inappropriate"", and there is not a hope in hell's chance that the feelings are mutual. I know that, I've always known that but it hasn't stopped the way I feel. Maybe if I was a naive 18 year old I could possibly make sense of this, but I'm not and I can't.
I've tried the online dating, initially just writing to a few people but ........ Nothing. Either they stop writing after a while or there's no spark there at all. In my day-to-day life I sometimes meet quite a few people, but again because my story isn't straightforward there's little possibility of anything developing. I don't have a social life, I have very few friends and am almost like a recluse (especially during the winter months).
I don't like Christmas, it holds too many unhappy memories for me and spending it alone every year (and seeing everyone else seemingly enjoying themselves with family, friends or loved ones just reinforces the feelings of emptiness, loneliness and 'oh what's the bloody point of it all'.
Sorry for unburdening on your thread, I was meant to be offering you words of support.
How are you with Christmas? Is it a good time for you or does it makes your feelings and emotions worse? Take care of yourself

"Hi again,
​You can't turn off feelings, both positive and negative. We all know this. Just as you can't not love someone, you can't make yourself think positively.
​Without being you, knowing the ins and outs of it, it is impossible to suggest what to do. You know what is and isn't possible and I can only give a sympathetic nod to what you must feel. Without wanting to seem patronising or insulting in anyway, is the fact it is so completely impossible not somewhat of a relief? I mean as much as that if someone or something is within reach then it is infuriating, turning your life in to a series of ""what if I just..."" with constant failure. If it is completely 100% impossible then your ONLY solution, as harsh as it sounds, is to somehow make peace with this. Now this actually gives you an aim, or something to talk about. Getting over this person, or finding a different passion should be your focus. I'm not saying that you will ever find anyone who may match this person but I'm sure you will acknowledge there is a danger of putting someone you have held in such high regard for such a long time on such a high pedestal that they are irreplaceable - much like fantasing about a celebrity, they're perfect. I don't know anyone who's perfect!
​When I write what I do, to you and others, I have to admit there is a level of devil's advocat and much of what I suggest is very much do as I say, not as I do! Again, in relation to the online dating, why stop? What really is the harm of chatting to new people? I'm sure there are more generic sites than strictly dating ones too. Take some solace in the fact few people's stories are straightforward, the one blessing we have in this world is you can contact more people than ever who will have a similar one to you. Gay, straight, black, white, transgender, ethnicity, religious beliefs, age gaps, disabilities, personal style and yes, even mental health issues, all have areas where like minded people can chat, look for comfort and get opinions. I'm sure your story is not so unusual that you could not develop things if you wished, I don't believe in soulmates - there are different level and different types of people for everyone. What one partner made you feel amazing in might be something the next doesn't, but they make you feel even better about something else.
​Do you want a social life? I ask that because it's a question I'm not sure I can answer myself. I love the idea of friends, I even miss the friends I had every day but I also question whether my mind is suited to them - I question and over-analyse everything and often feel worse about myself the more I am around others. So wanting to be sociable is a tricky area. However, if you do want to be sociable, what can be done about it? You're the second or third person on here I have spoken to of a similar age, if there is nothing to do in person then I'm sure there are places online. Very few friends is also some friends. Spend more time with them, if they want and you don't feel pushy. Are any of them alone? Winter months are particuarly bad time for lots of people, SAD kicks in even if mild, people stay in doors and the focus on family can become overbearing...
​Which brings me to your Christmas question. I love the magic of Christmas, there is an escapism feel to it. But the reality is much much harder. I have been fortunate enough to escape the last two years in New York to have a magical christmas (living an Xmas movies!) without family pressues but this year, due to money and other reasons, I'm back doing the whole family thing. And I'm dreading it. My family are ok, to lovely to amazing but it's just the pressure of acting confident, talking about my life and future, comparing myself to others and feeling very much the outsider I hate. I know most of this is me but by Xmas Eve I'm fairly sure I'll be in fight or flight mode! One year I literally had to be dragged from my house as I refused to leave it. Do you have family? If not, do you have friends that are also alone? What about volunteering somewhere Xmas day, do something different - I'm sure there are loads of people and institutions that need help or volunteers and would help you focus on things other than yourself. That's the key, focus on yourself and you'll only see things that are lacking or flaws, but go to a hospital or a old people's home or something and you'll be chatting to them.
And in truth, that's what I still do on here - that's why I'm still writing and replying ages after the initial thread. My feelings haven't changed, I have good days and bad and I do balance on the edge of trying and giving up but talking to yourself and others helps me take the focus away from me. Me is not a good subject. Look above and see all the different things I've said to different people - hopefully it helped them even one percent but it's helped me a little too. It's not helped me feel better about myself (often the opposite!) but it has achieved one simple aim - it stopped me thinking about myself for a short time. Depression is a selfish disease and I don't mean that in a bad way - most people on here seem fairly nice, caring and generoud - but it is the focus on what's bad about yourself. How you effect others. How I could be better. Not thinking about it for an hour is kind of nice.
​Please never apologise for unburdening on the thread! In fact never feel sorry for unburdening to anyone - that's what this and friends are for.
​I'm sure there is nothing you haven't thought or heard before from what I've said but do remember that, if you want, you're not alone. I don't know what your name is, where you're from, what you do, what you've done. I don't know if you have views that are polar opposite to me, have the same interests or even moral compass but it doesn't mean I won't listen. I'm a complete stranger writing on a message board to you for the second or third time and I'd like to help. I'm not unique. There are loads on here, and loads in the real world. Some will help you more than others, some will be able to empathise better, some will have similar experiences. But they're out there and with the internet they're closer than ever. If you want friends, even if online ones, they're out there and you definitely can find them. Take a step, see what happens next.
Good luck.

"Hi again rsjg hope you are doing ok at this time?
You write so well and make sense in your comments, you certainly sound very level headed. I've not been on this forum for about a week but am back tonight because I am feeling so low and hopeless/helpless. (I really should start my own topic rather than hijacking yours, but wonder whether I would get any responses)
My head and emotions are in turmoil (as they have been for the last year) and at present I feel like I just do not want to go on. The problem I have described a bit in my previous comments to you, is still very much at the forefront of all that is going wrong with my life, but it has now taken on an unexpected and worrying twist. Things could well come to an unpleasant conclusion later this week - I am intending to see the person I have fallen in love with, and right now rather than looking forward to it I am dreading it and am scared how it will pan out. The worst case scenario is that the meeting goes horribly wrong and I end up walking away for the final time - I fear that the bad news I am expecting will push me over the edge. Apart from my counsellor I have nobody I can talk to in detail about my problems and there does seen only one permanent solution to the awful emptiness, loneliness and never-ending crisis I am in. Whether I have the necessary courage to end it all, right now I really can't say. Nobody will miss me, so what is the point of going on?

"Hi again,
​Is it bad that my best response to you is just the will to give you a hug?! And take that as a compliment, I don't do hugs!! And hijack away, I am subtly trying to ignore me...
​It's so hard to help without specifics, so that I know that I'm not talking rubbish or saying something stupid. Is there anyone you can speak to in confidence? I wouldn't expect you to reveal all on here!
​So once again I'm going to try and reply with honest intent, so please don't be offended if anything is way off base. You say that it has taken a worrying and unexpected twist - I think you need to look at it differently. I believe the worst part of most things is not knowing, good or bad. For example when waiting for a job offer you might be a bag of nerves but once the call comes, positive or otherwise, there is the release of tension. Obviously all those emotions are heightened when it is a relationship but you have to try and look at this weeks possible conclusion as closure - either it'll work out perfectly or it's finished forever.
​So plan for the worst. What's the absolute worst thing that could happen? The person doesn't respond in the appropriate way, shuns you. There are ripple effects that mean others shun you (I'm doing proper doomsday response here - I don;t know how inappropriate your feelings are). Is that really going to make you feel worse than you do this very minute? You already believe it anyway. So knowing you were right, knowing it was a disaster, what do you do? What can you do? You have to move on, as hard as it'll be. But surely that's a billion times better that this state of depression limbo where you hate day to day but keep going because of the whole 'what if'. It's like waiting to be sacked or something - you're fairly sure it's coming, you don't want it to but the pressure of it daily means then when it finally does come there is an element of relief.
​I think you're wrong no-one will miss you. I often think about 'going' but I still think people would miss me - just that they'd be better off. That's a different argument. But if we go back to your no-one will miss you argument and even assume it's true - then why care about them enough to do it? Find people (friends, work whatever) that would miss you for you. Family?
​In fact I would go as far as to say, as much as I recognise the strong emotions of love and what it can make you feel and do, should one person dictate your happiness? Think about that - you're so focused on this person, why do they hold the key to everything? No-one is that good, no-one. Focus on YOU not them.
​I hope it works out for you, but I suspect from what you say that it won't. I'm a realist. So all I will say is I, your counsellor, and probably loads of pother people on here and in your life will be more than happy to listen and help as you so desire. The worst case scenario is they 'die' to you -but that doesn't mean you have to - even widows move on, life moves on, painful as it may be for long periods of time. But love can be refound, remade, adjusted and different from one person to the next. Never put all your happiness on to one person, because even with the best will in the world it is inevitably going to fail.
​Good luck, I'm always here to reply, as bad as my attempts may be!

"Hello again, well I saw the person I'm in love with earlier tonight and what I had been worrying about didn't happen. But sadly the worst thing that could happen has happened and I have seen her for the last time. I've just made it sound so straightforward, but believe me it was a lot more complicated than that.
I feel so empty and alone now, haven't stopped crying for 3 hours and have emptiness ahead of me. The only family I have are moving away from the area next week, I only have 2 friends (both in long term relationships & rarely see or speak to them), am very long-term unemployed because of my mental health problems.
i feel like I don't have anything to live for anymore

"I happened to be online...
Right. First things first - just grieve a little. It's not wrong to be upset. You should be. Just live each day by day until it hurts just a little less - you cried for three hours today because of the hurt, but I doubt you'll cry that much in a months time because time will pass, it'll still hurt but a tiny bit less. Eventually it'll hurt enough to live with, even if the pain never completely goes.
Again, focus on the positives. At least you have two friends, so be the one to initiate contact, meet for a Xmas drink. It doesn't ned to be a big heart to heart, just a distraction, take yourself out your own mind. As for family, and friends for that matter, distance isn't important - I have closer relationships with family members who are hundreds of miles away than ones down the road. There's phones, emails, skype or just make time to travel every so often. Don't use distance as an easy excuse.
Love is never straightforward, even when it goes well. One lost love, whatever your age, sexuality, race or anything else does not mean game over. I don't believe in soulmates, you just fit better with some people more than others, all relationships require work, and you may well find, one day, someone else that fits well with you. But there's no rush, although now you must accept you should look - there is no 'what if' now.
There's plenty to live for. At least two friends, some family that will like to hear a voice from home and the chance of a better life, a better mental health. If, and I am slightly rose-tinting, this situation ends up being the closure you needed to move on then maybe, just maybe, your life may end up being better than you ever imagined.
Don't make decisions in a period of grief, recognise it as that. If you still feel this strongly in 6 months to a year then I'd be surprised. You'll still hurt, I'm not silly, but you'll begin to see opportunities. There is no ONE person for anyone, so eventually you'll be able to imagine a life that hasn't got this one person on a pedestal. I truly believe that.
Good luck, always happy to talk (and argue!) with you.

"What a mess, life is made up of different people in your life year after year. Can't think about ending your life over of one relationship.. I've learned long time ago got to be able to live with yourself, love yourself, accept yourself before somebody else can.. There's always another woman that you will meet sooner or later. I know after a relationship that can be extremely hard to get over that person. If it's a first love that's a different story. You should get away from the situation and give her some breathing room.... that's the the only way it'll work... I've been there too many times . Bury yourself in work even if it's somewhere you don't want to work .. find a therapist and work on the second step! Work your problems out. You can never give up... I have a physically disabled and not many women are out there looking for somebody like me. My head is lying on my shoulder and I will probably end up alone.. I've learned and depend on being alone myself. But to think about killing yourself over a woman when there are so many out there.. Best thing to do is to go on a date.. Family is family and its unconditional love. Its good to have time away from family every once in awhile. If staying away and given her room doesn't work you have to find the strength to move on.. I know saying and doing it is a whole different story but you have to. It's hard to think of the aftermath of what would happen if you hurt yourself. Your family suffers for the rest of their lives. If there's any kids in the family please think of them because they will take the same way out one of these days, I'm not saying all of them but just one of them increases the chances.. Everyone as a lot of demons and bones in their closet to deal with and before you can be whole you have to deal with your own problems.. Good luck, if you need help you know what to do..

"Hi Antonio04801. I speak with ZERO authority on the topic but if you know you're Bipolar, and have been diagnosed etc, then clearly you need further help from the medical profession as regards your feelings. Perhaps a change of medication or something?
​What you describe in brief is very much the symptoms of bipolar, as I understand it, so you need to look at the causes and triggers and if you've gone through the stages to be diagnosed, I hope the next stage is successful.
​Being happy is such a difficult term, just focus on the here and now and then work out about being happy. I wish you luck.

Meanwhile fill your ""Time"" in a positive way.Suggestions;
Maybe Clear the garden(its THERAPUTIC) Paint& Decorate a room=You are now Occupied in a POSITIVE way.EXMAS. Focus upon presents that are interesting/unique etc Not expensive=Its the thought that counts.

Find a ""Hobby"" an interest that you can immerse yourself with completely(Its THERAPUTIC).EG: Art,music,craft...find it.It won't find you otherwise will it.NURTURE your ""Interest"" it will now also allow you to focus upon self improvement & not self defeat.The Hobby may include others who share similar interests etc...Isolation now being attended too.Your own self esteem now raised..improves everything else=A Chain reaction.
Instead of dwelling in the past,which has proven to end negatively...Change it.Think positively.
At first it will be hard.it will feel ""Alien""...A false lifestyle..but persevere here.Soon it becomes natural to just Smile as & when.Feel good factor impregnates itself.You don't have to be the ""Soul of the party:..just be yourself.As & when.Rrom there the day will seem brighter.Make it so.even if it rains.

"I stumbled upon this post on Google. I was bursting with tears while reading this. My reflection to every single word and I know how you feel. Although I'm only 26 I'm already tired of life. Maybe it's just momentarily but the fact is I lived your life for the past few years now and it's getting worse...
I started as enthusiastic, full of inspiration and many talents, people told me I have. They said I will become great one day. I realized I'm a bit above average when it comes to art and learning, not to bust my ego too much. Over the years I achieved my goals and my dreams when it comes to music. I was working day and night literally while others were partying and having fun. I had a vision which I claimed. The beauty of that is overwhelming and I'll always be proud of that. That was in my college years when I had so much time I didn't know what to do with now so precious luxury.
Few years ago I got ever so cought up into a thing called system. I started working full time job (not a bad one, but definitely now what I would want to do). Now I'm stuck here, working every day, besides my own company I spent a year working 14 -16 hours daily, trying to make a financial escape route for me to keep creating what I love to do. It was all for nothing. It's still early to talk about this but my energy is drained. I still live with my parents, no proper relationship to afford a self sustaining life.
Another parallel cause and the biggest one of my current state is my love life. I had quite a few girlfriends over the years but none had time for me at the end even though I tried as hard as I could. Last few years were the worst. I have 3rd girl in a row with serious issues and events at home. One had drug addict dad at age of 4 which she had to take care of, while mom left both of them. She had terrible depressions. One had a really big farm at home they couldn't sell and only a demonic mother and 12 year old brother. She just lost her great father to cancer at that time. The one I'm with now has a deeply depressed unemployed extremely possessive mother who's brainwashing entire family since she was a child.
The second one ended in tragedy with a sudden cut. I hardly came back to right mind one year ago. But consequences remain... The fear of losing someone is just so sensitive now to me. It gets even worse because I do EVERYTHING to make it right I'm often a bit forceful with offering help. I know this can easily be destructive but I just can't watch the person I love, suffer.
When I found out about their problems at early stage of relationship I didn't back out, even though I could if I was selfish. Im a helper by nature and the feeling of happiness I feel around people in need, even just temporal (which usually is), is my soul food. This is the only thing that keeps me going right now. Still things are repeating similar way between us like with my last girlfriend. She can't even wash her clothes at home without her mom yelling and beating her psychologically. She can rarely go out at the age of 24! Her parents obviously don't know about me, yet I presented her to my whole family. She's at college and having highest grades possible, but her parents don't care. I help her all the time too. Hours and hours of projects almost every day. This time I know I really did all I could. I even brought her food many times when she couldn't even cook because of her mom (even though she didn't ask me to), I offered her constant financial support, with no need of money return, all the little things and excitements just to see her smile and joy by my side, yet she feels burdened with debt even though I'm telling her all the time it's my choice and love to her that's doing this.. At the same time I was the miser to my own self with everything and now becoming a ticking time bomb of negetivity due to reality of being stuck at the same point after so much effort put. I'm losing the grip and sinking my love life at the same time. I also know I can't be happy without someone to love and journey through life.
The dream to find someone I'll share my life with has been my dream since I was 13/14 while majority thought only about one thing. Since then my story repeats and gets more intense each time.
I always tried to be good, especially when I was little. My childhood was perfect. Maybe this is the two bladed sword of tasting the reality now. I always stayed by side much as I could and be at service. But this mostly negative world has corrupted me. So much greed, so much blindness over power everywhere. The repetitive cycle over and over again, but I will try to stay good and do good until the last day I stand.
I hope this doesn't sound too negative it's just my story. There are a lot of happy places on this planet you have to look for, mainly outside the system where life is more primitive to western world yet unimaginably richer in a spiritual and mental way. If things go too far this will be my final escape route.
Stay strong rsjg and I hope last paragraph gives you a few more options to look at towards happiness.
I want to hug you as a friend, that's my feeling since I red your story and the reason I registered and wrote all of this.
Merry Christmas and strong and happy new year brother!

"I'm not even sure I have depression, I think this may just be 'me'.
I have always been pretty useless socially, but have had a normal upbringing, no horrible experiences, have gone through education fine and even got jobs but I've never enjoyed life, never really cared and normally feel like I'm not really worth anything and, inevitably enventually, will become a burden.
I'm not going to be dramatic and say I'm going to end it, it sounds so pathetic (no offence intended to anyone) but I have thoughts of 'going' or even dreams that I could die 'blamelessly' thorugh accident or illness. Selfish I know.
I have a cycle. Get job, put on confident easy going persona, get physically tired from doing that, lose energy to maintain job, focus on negative, leave job in some form (fired/quit). Friends are much the same, play easy going fun, can't keep it up, lose or push them away. Relationships, get attracted to ones who need help, help them in anyway I can, get to a point where I feel I am no more use so should go as they'd be ultimately better off.
So, currently I've quit my job as a teacher, couldn't take it - always something to improve and with my way of thinking that just sounds like constantly someone telling you you're useless (and it backing up your own thoughts anyway) but even though I liked aspects of my job I don't think I had a passion like I see in others. I felt I'd let everyone down so disappeared, my partner/ parents got me through immediate days after my sudden departure from work and saw Doc who was nice enough - put me on medication which seemed to do very little - even after a few months. In fact it only had negative side effects so about three weeks ago I stopped taking them completely. I also started seeing a CBT person about three/four session ago but this feels like it's doing nothing at all either, we talk, I'm honest as I can be but there is some element of being 'public' and putting on that face/ jokey responses.
I dip between a wish to not be around that is forever there and seems to be backed up with wholly logical reasons that people genuinely struggle to refute to absolutely crashing panic attacks/ given up when my 'theories' are proved.
I know this sounds odd, but I don't even have the will to get 'better', largely because I don't think I can. I am just 'me'. I am negative, boring and even if it is all just selffullfillng profecies - it's still me who has done that. I'm not blaming life, or others or anything else.
A lot of the posts I read on here seem to have good reason; PTS, loss, finances etc - does anyone have no 'good' reason?
I just feel I'm never going to be happy, I am soon to be much a burden on those around me (my gf) and that, in the long run, it'd be better for all if I just went. I know my family and gf love me - but time heals, life would get better and people move on. In the long run I'm sure it wouldn't effect my family and 100% sure my gf would be better off.
Not sure if there is an answer for this, just writing. I'm not angry, I'm not hurt, I'm not even sad as such, I'm just tired...

"I have suffered from depression for many years. i have had many antidepressant tablets, but they don't help. In fact they can make you feel worse. I come across as confident and bubbly, but it's all a pretence and you have only keep this pretence up for a limited period of time and your (depression) which manifests its self in many different ways for different people ultimately comes out. Not being able to deal with situations very well, showing your anger, over thinking of situations, over re-acting has had an adverse emotional problem on my son.
I felt happier after leaving my husband and my job, where i was constantly bullied. I met someone else and moved in with him after a short period of time. We've been together for 3 years. which sounds hunkie dorie, but I now live in a very isolated area and have no family near by. I was mislead and misinformed about my new home and work and he previous woman left after having a breakdown. I unfortunately then entered her world. I was back on antidepressants and found I couldn’t stop crying, big uncontrollable sobbing. I became hateful of everything and everyone about me. My moods would be from suicidal to extreme anger. My blood pressure was extremely high that I had a monitor to carry around. ‘Hypertensive Crisis’. Manager reaction was if it was that bad the doctor wold sign me off. Doctor had tried to persuade me to do this, but I was the only experience member of staff in my field. After hearing my managers support I went back to doctor and he immediately signed me off.
After an incident at work, I was transferred. I had been asking for a transfer after only being there a few months. 2.5 years later and I couldn’t take anymore and there was a scene at work. Not the way I would of liked it to of happen, I was out of there.
Even though I am in a better place, I still suffer from depression and the smallest thing can set it off. I still have bouts of uncontrollable crying, still haven’t slept in years and still unsettled and go over different plans in my head to pack up and escape. My partner tells me he loves me all the time, which is reassuring, but also trapping. I do not like myself and really don’t seem to like many other people. That’s probably due to mistrust and my constant negativity that consumes me.
Yes, I am aware of how negative thoughts consuming oneself is very destructive, but that is part of depression and this is what many people battle with and feel that they are not in control and try very hard to regain some happiness. I am also very aware that my depressive negative feelings infects other people and that is why cutting out the cancer is seen as a humane way to go to release the burden on others. As Mr Spock said “ The needs of the many out way the needs of the one.”

"You sound like you've had a lot of bad things happen to you and also as a result of your depression. I think you need to look at getting the depression looked at before you consider anything else. If you have had 'hypertensive crisis' then you know your doctor well I assume and need to ask for some more help - just because it's not physical doesn't mean it's not as important.
​You need to get out the cycle then evaluate where you are. You have a lot to say so share it with someone who can help - even just print off what you wrote.
Good luck.

"Sorry for answering so long after your original post.
Your title really spoke to me, that's exactly how i feel, i don't have any real problems or issues in my life, no mental illness, decent job, good relationship, but i am just tired of being alive, and want to stop.
Every morning i wake up i'm diappointed that i am still here. I'm not looking fofr help or sympathy i probably shouldn't even be saying anything.
I so agree with you that i don't weant to sound dramatic or anything there is no drama in this, just tired. I just don't want to deal with the day to day grind of going to work and handling lifes little problems, i'm just so lazy that everything is too much for me.
Anyway, sorry for bothering you with this, just felt like typing it out for some reason and this seemed like a place where i wouldn't get a bunch of people telling me not to think this way.
Thanks

"What more is there to say... than I hear you. It's seeing a point with putting up with all the little niggles that life brings - if there is no end game, no reward, no happiness then it does beg the question why bother...
​But we go on. We do, we try (sometimes), we pretend (often), we get tired (always) but go on we do in the hope we're wrong and others are right. I am losing the patience to believe in others optimism. This is it. I think I'm on the final run now.

"Thanks for your answer. For some reason i feel obliged to say that i'm sorry you feel like you're on your final run, even though that's exactly how i feel as well.
I actually feel better and happier since i've come up with a plan and a rough timeline.
I still would prefer it to happen to me rather than do it myself, being lazy again i guess, but also becasue i don't really want to be remembered as that guy.
In response to your coment about going on, i would say that i already think that other people are right. Most arguments i've heard for going on is valid and correct. Itès just that for me, they are no longer sufficient to overcome how tired i am of trying. If i were to win millions in alottery so that i could just do what i want with no responsibilities then i would be fine. But that isn't going to happen and anything that takes any more effort is beyond me.

"Hi I understand everything you are saying but will say the following. I felt like that many times in my life but just put off attempting suicide lots of times, and just struggled on day by day. Before I realised it I had retired and now my life has changed so much for the better. I am glad I put it off.
I don't know what your situation is exactly or how old you are but it might give you something to think about.
Now I get up when I want, do what I want and make sure I never have to work again or do anything I don't want to. Is that worth carrying on for? I don't know. x

"Thanks for your answer hypercat
Sorry if this gets posted twice, it went for moderation and i assume it's becasue i used a bad word so i've edited to see if that was the issue.
Yes, you are absolutely correct and i've been doing that for years. Sadly i am 52 now and do not have nearly enough for retirement, to even survive let alone be comfortable.
I was fired from my job of 17 years a year ago and just recently found a short term contract position, which is ending in a month at which time i will have no money.
I have no desire at all to scramble around trying to find another position just to struggle trhough until i'm too old to work and still can't afford to retire.
i really do appreciate your comments and i know and recognize that i sound like jerk about this. I know there are millions of people working their way through much worse situations than i have ever had, i am just very weak and lazy and don't want to deal with even the good life that i've had.
I can't explain it, it's just how i feel.
sorry i can't even read that myself without seeing how stupid i sound.

"Hi Johnny I get that completely and no you are not a jerk! I have been in the same position before more than once and hated it. I have found I have had periods in my life where I am very poor then other times when I am solvent. Every time I re-entered a poor time I hated it, but tried to see it as a challenge and see if I could remember how to cope. Things usually pick up again one day. .
You never know what is around the corner and my curiosity kept me going. As did my leisure activities, friends and a good sense of humour.
I am very lazy too but just tried to get jobs I didn't mind doing too much and used it as a means to an end ie enjoy the rest of my life outside work.
Do you have any private pensions you can draw at 60? Can you cut your outgoings? Would you be able to think about doing part time work in a few years? Have you any hobbies you enjoy?
It would seem a shame after working all your life not to enjoy the good times which can come later.
Do you think your depression is under control? Bev x

"Thanks again Bev
it's really kind of you to take the time and effort to talk to me.
i admire the strength you have to see being poor as a challenge and to accept the challenge, but i just don't have it in me to face even the possibility that i might lose my house and lifestyle. i've been afraid of being homeless and on the street most of my life because i know i could never do it.
i agree with you about curiosity keeping you going, it has for me for a long time, but lately i've been thinking ""if i had dfies 20 years ago look at all i would have missed"" and those have been the best 20 years of my life where i did a lot of good things, i realize that had i not experienced them i wouldn't have missed them. Also i think about things i would have liked to do that even if i live a long time from now that i will never get to do, and i find i'm not heartbroken at not doing those either, so curiosity for the future just isn't enough anymore.
As for leisure activities, i used to enjoy doing a lot of things, and while i still do some of them, i no longer enjoy them, or well anything really.
I have only 60K in my retirement account and while your suggestion of cutting outgoings makes sense, once again, it's something i don't think i will be able to do.
i find it interesting that you ask if my depression is under control, i guess since this is a depression forum that's understandable, but i don't think i have any mental illness, including depression. i have been crying every so often for not much reason which i don't understand and i'm sad sometimes but i don't think it is depression.
It's kind of you to say i'm not a jerk (that wasn't the word i used originally, but i think that's why the first post wasn't allowed ) however i don't know how else to describe someone that has had every advantage in life and enjoyed a mostly problem free, fun interesting life and can't even handle such an easy life to the point where i am willing to hurt the people that care about me (and yes i have people that care about me, including my wife who will be financially devastated when i'm gone) by ending it
in my case suicide would be all of the negative things that people say that it is, but i just feel like i have to. the only time i really feel ... not happy, but content is when i think of my resolve to exit soon.
i'm sorry that i'm not easier to talk to, i do appreciate your efforts to help, you are a wonderful person

"No I am not wonderful Jonny - but what I am is have been there and even got the cruddy T-shirt, but thank you for saying that. Makes me feel good.
I am going to disagree with you - I think you have depression but refuse to let it head room. I saw some stats recently that said that the most common cause of death in men aged between 25 and 45 is suicide. I think this is often because men refuse to admit they have a problem and won't talk about it with anyone. They see it as shameful and weak and not manly. Does this sound like you?
If you are thinking seriously about suicide there is something very wrong as that is a red flag. You have opened up to us on here which is very brave, so now take the next step and see your doctor. Please.
Please don't be one of the statistics Johnny. Bev xx

"I will disagree on the subject of your wonderfuness. You may not think so, but the patience and kindness you’ve shown, make me think that you are in fact pretty great. IT can’t be easy for you especially because you’ve been here.
You may be right, i may have depression. i’ve read about it and i honestly don’t think i have the symptoms and signs of having clinical depression, but i’m no doctor so i may be totally wrong.
I do see myself as weak, i don’t know how else to see it when someone like me thinks life is too hard. I read other people's stories of abuse and loss and i have experienced nothing even close to that yet here i am whining and feeling sorry for myself.
The thought of asking for help terrifies me, and i am not strong enough to do it. There’s no way i can talk about this without sounding like a giant whiney baby and i will be dismissed as such. Even if help came to me without me asking for it, i don’t think i could handle it. I am unable to deal with anyone showing sympathy for me or trying to help, it makes me cry which makes me push them away. just writing this is taking hours as it has me in tears and i’m at work, so i have to stop after every few words to collect myself to be able to write more.
I’m also really afraid that if i were to get help that it might actually... help and for me right now that seems like the worst possible thing, that i might be talked out of it. So at best it would be a waste of time and at worst it could “cure” me. I just don’t have the energy to try. not to try to find another job, or to find help or anything really. i barely have the energy to even go through with this, but as it’s the last thing i will have to do and i’ve found what i think will be a fairly easy way, i think i can manage to get it done.
I hate the way i sound in these messages, it’s exactly what i didn’t want to be, it seems overly dramatic and important, when i feel like the original post, it isn’t important, it isn’t dramatic, i’m just done and want to quit.

"No Johnny you will not be dismissed by anyone as a 'giant whiney baby' Doctors tend to take depression in men more seriously especially if they are a man themselves coz they know how hard it is to admit it.
Depression is an illness and it can strike anyone. There are many different types of depression you know and you might not have the clinical one. But the fact you are talking about suicide means something is definitely wrong.
I suffered and still do from depression for many years but it is nowhere near as bad as it was because I am on ad's and had counselling. Now I can generally live with it and have a pretty good life which means something to me.
Depression can strike anyone at anytime and is an illness the same as say cancer is. It can also be very serious. It is nothing in you which has caused this - YOU ARE NOT TO BLAME!
Isn't it worth giving yourself the chance for life for yourself and your family before going the ultimate route? After all you have nothing to lose do you? If you give it plenty of time and you still don't feel better you can still go ahead can't you? You have lost nothing by waiting and seeking help first.
Write down how you feel if you life and just give it to the doctor. Or take someone with you who understands and can talk for you. It would be such a shame if you refuse to do this. You will then become one of the sad statistics - do you want that? Then everyone can go 'I am so shocked I never knew he was in such a bad way'. I have had this with friends before and I don't want it with another friend if you don't mind!
I am calling you a friend because you are now. Listen to Aunty Bev and seek help otherwise I WILL call you a 'giant whiney baby' Ok? Bev xx

"Thank you Bev, i understand your points and they are very well made, however i’m afraid that i’m just wasting your time and effort. You are probably right that a doctor might well take it seriously (although my doctor is a woman). It’s not the doctor that will think i’m a giant baby, it’s everyone i know. i’m already well known as whiny and annoying to everyone that knows me, complaining that i’m depressed and upset will just confirm and increase their view of me. Please don’t think i i’m blaming them, they are all good people and they are my friends and loved ones, it’s just that is their honest assessment of me and i agree with them, they are absolutely correct.
i did try about a year ago to mention it too her, but i can’t bring myself to form the words, when i try i just get overwhelmed with a feeling that i’m complaining over nothing, and instead take it back and minimize it as much as possible. So when i did that she didn’t pick up on the original request which is totally reasonable, she was busy and i really didn’t say anything. i can’t see another attempt being any more successful.
I do know that depression is an illness and can strike anyone, i’m just not sure that it’s necessarily the case with me, i suspect that i’m just too weak to survive. If i’d been born into almost any other time or circumstance when survival was hard, i would never have got to this age, it’s only because life is so easy now that i haven’t died due to my own laziness or stupidity.
i’m not talking about suicide anywhere but here because i don’t want to make the proverbial “cry for help”, i’m not looking for help,i’m just … done. if i were younger i’d agree with you that i should stick around and things would get better, that is exactly what i did when i was a teenager, and it got me to here. But now i’m 52, there is not much chance at all of anything improving significantly and i realize that it wouldn’t have been a bad thing if i’d done it when i was 17, there’s nothing that i’ve done since then that i look back on and think “well that was worth all the hassle”. the daily grind of living still outweighs everything else in my case.
As for what i have to lose by trying? i do have something to lose, i lose the chance to not have to experience tomorrow. i don’t know how to make someone understand how much i want to just stop. Stop getting up in the morning, stop dealing with people, stop having responsibilities, stop everything. i’ve been putting it off for years, now i don’t want to put it off anymore. you ask if i want to be a statistic as if the answer is obvious and clear, yet my answer is the opposite you expect, YES! i want to be nothing more than a statistic that sounds like the best possible thing to me, and i don’t think it’s a particularly sad one, millions of people die every day, one more makes no difference in the world.
it’s so nice of you to consider me a friend, and i know you’re joking about calling me that, but seriously that has no effect on me, as i already know it to be true i really do feel bad that i even made a post here now and caused you to waste your time and effort, you’d be much better served to focus on people here that need and want to be helped.
Sorry

I say 'friend' coz I know exactly where you are coming from and where you are at, so in that sense we are soul mates Ok? I will never meet you or vice versa but the connection is there at least for me if not you.
Your daily life is a grind because you are suffering from depression and from the sounds of it have been for many years. Think how much time you have wasted already by not dealing with it! Go and see a male doctor if the female one puts you off...
Every person is unique and as I value life I think this is a loss to everyone. I think you like to think of yourself as weak so you can feel sorry for yourself and justify your intentions.
I can tell it's depression coz I am pretty expert at it myself you know. The negative thoughts are there in everything you say and do and that's a dead giveaway. What have you to lose by admitting it?
You don't need to tell the whole world you are suffering from depression you know, so if they don't know they won't see you as weak will they? Do you think I tell everyone? No way. My family don't understand or care but some of my friends do because they have experienced it themselves. I talk on here a lot about it and a couple of other sites I am on. That's enough people who know.
If you tackle your depression then your life won't be a daily grind any more and you will have a future. You are very deep in self pity at the moment and I want to give you a slap!
I am not giving up on you though friend so you can count on that. Bev xx

If you choose to consider me a friend then i am grateful, thank you
If you think i’m suffering from depression, i won’t argue with you, it’s certainly possible, i only mean that i’ve never been diagnosed with anything when i say i’m not sure i have anything.
Having a female doctor doesn’t prevent me from talking about it, i much prefer to deal with women than men, men intimidate me.
Other than that you are completely correct i’m sure, i am certainly feeling sorry for myself, and am very deep in self pity, and yes i haven’t ever tried to get any help. But right now, i don’t want help. i can't even imagine having the desire to get better, i just want to go away and not have to do anything anymore.

"I do consider you are friend Johnny. However I am not a doctor and can't give you a diagnosis of depression, but you do show lots of symptoms of it. One of the major symptoms is the 'I don't care' attitude and 'I don't want to get better coz it's not worth it'. Don't you believe these are depression thoughts? A part of you does care coz otherwise why did you come on here in the first place?
No one can make you seek help if you choose not to but it would be a pity not to give yourself a chance wouldn't it? But there you go.
However be aware that it's not that easy to commit suicide - have you ever looked into it? There are some sites on here for that so have a google. I have and it always puts me right off! All of them sound nasty and painful - yuck! I hope you don't though and you know where I am Bev xx

"Thank again Bev.
i understand you saying “A part of you does care coz otherwise why did you come on here in the first place?” and i won’t say that there is no part of me that cares, but i did pick this particular post to respond to because it sounded so much like how i was feeling and it seemed unlikely that i would get people trying to “save” me or talk me out of it.
You are also right about the methods of suicide, that’s a big reason why i’ve never even gone as far as planning it before, i had never heard of a way that didn’t seem terribly scary or painful ar nasty. However i do now have plan for a way that seems like it might be workable for me.
At this time, you will be happy to know that i’m feeling a little better and even considering trying my doctor. Not sure why, and i’m not saying i don’t still want to go, but it seems less pressing today than it did a couple of days ago.
i am scared that i won’t be able to deal with talking about it in person, i will either appear appear to happy and calm and will be dismissed or i won’t even be able to talk about it without breaking down and crying which will look like i’m faking it. i know, it’s silly to worry about those things but, i do, a lot.
Anyway, we’ll see what happens i guess.

"I'm not even sure I have depression, I think this may just be 'me'.
I have always been pretty useless socially, but have had a normal upbringing, no horrible experiences, have gone through education fine and even got jobs but I've never enjoyed life, never really cared and normally feel like I'm not really worth anything and, inevitably enventually, will become a burden.
I'm not going to be dramatic and say I'm going to end it, it sounds so pathetic (no offence intended to anyone) but I have thoughts of 'going' or even dreams that I could die 'blamelessly' thorugh accident or illness. Selfish I know.
I have a cycle. Get job, put on confident easy going persona, get physically tired from doing that, lose energy to maintain job, focus on negative, leave job in some form (fired/quit). Friends are much the same, play easy going fun, can't keep it up, lose or push them away. Relationships, get attracted to ones who need help, help them in anyway I can, get to a point where I feel I am no more use so should go as they'd be ultimately better off.
So, currently I've quit my job as a teacher, couldn't take it - always something to improve and with my way of thinking that just sounds like constantly someone telling you you're useless (and it backing up your own thoughts anyway) but even though I liked aspects of my job I don't think I had a passion like I see in others. I felt I'd let everyone down so disappeared, my partner/ parents got me through immediate days after my sudden departure from work and saw Doc who was nice enough - put me on medication which seemed to do very little - even after a few months. In fact it only had negative side effects so about three weeks ago I stopped taking them completely. I also started seeing a CBT person about three/four session ago but this feels like it's doing nothing at all either, we talk, I'm honest as I can be but there is some element of being 'public' and putting on that face/ jokey responses.
I dip between a wish to not be around that is forever there and seems to be backed up with wholly logical reasons that people genuinely struggle to refute to absolutely crashing panic attacks/ given up when my 'theories' are proved.
I know this sounds odd, but I don't even have the will to get 'better', largely because I don't think I can. I am just 'me'. I am negative, boring and even if it is all just selffullfillng profecies - it's still me who has done that. I'm not blaming life, or others or anything else.
A lot of the posts I read on here seem to have good reason; PTS, loss, finances etc - does anyone have no 'good' reason?
I just feel I'm never going to be happy, I am soon to be much a burden on those around me (my gf) and that, in the long run, it'd be better for all if I just went. I know my family and gf love me - but time heals, life would get better and people move on. In the long run I'm sure it wouldn't effect my family and 100% sure my gf would be better off.
Not sure if there is an answer for this, just writing. I'm not angry, I'm not hurt, I'm not even sad as such, I'm just tired...

"I've never replied to any of these but when I read yours I felt like I was reading exactly what I would have written. Even your replies were identical - right down to researching HFAS - just out of interest. I'm sorry if I step on toes; I'm actually just blurbing my thoughts after reading your post as a way of processing my own thoughts really. I'm always open to learning new things but I always end up at the same pointless reasoning you speak about. I have tried talking to people and therapists and whenever I get to the topic of the point of life no one seems to prove to me otherwise that life is inevitably pointless. I would love to just slink into the background and disappear, preferably in a way that doesn't hurt my bf, family or friends. I have also felt like a type of burden on them. I also have the exact same cycle with jobs, friends etc. I tried medication with the exact same result. I took myself off them after awhile. And I'm in this state for absolute no reason at all; well no conventional reason any way.
The thing that caught my attention though about your post was your people-pleasing habit. I feel like the ""reason"" may actually lie in that habit. I have the exact same thing; the easy-going casual confidence. I actually let myself go for so long at one point that I got chronic fatigue and ended up in a nursing home for 3 months because i was physcially so tired. After i recovered I thought it was caused by my lack of personal boundaries and inability to say no to people always needing me (which is a people-pleasing trait) but years later i realise that its deeper than that. People pleasing is the cause for all this depression and pointlessness (however, not the root cause)
Think about it, I know you will because, like me, we over-think everything. It's why we are so good at people pleasing. When you think so much, you're fully aware of other people's needs at all times so you get good at knowing what the ""right thing"" is to say or portray and everybody loves the 'cool, calm and collected folk'. This all gets very tiring for people like us though because essentially that is not who you are in essence. (I'm actually quite socially anxious, I get panicky over small things etc) Everytime you do that you're pushing yourself down to please others. (I do seem to find happiness in pleasing others but this is temporary and tiring and feeding a habit). Finding out the real reason for why you do that is key to possibly lessening the depression. I think the reasons differ for each individual. Whether it be self-worth issues, lack of confidence, learnt behaviour from parents/society, habitual/addictive behaviour. (those are the root-causes) Why do you like to people-please? What is the real reason. I think we know all these answers when we're honest deep-down but if not, the answers uncover themselves when we ask ourselves these questions repeatedly.
Life is pointless when you're not living it the way you want to be or living it the way that feeds you and stimulates you appropriately. Living life for everyone else is incredibly tiring leaving you with no energy to be bothered to live life for you. You're literally not fulfilling yourself..leaving yourself empty, without purpose...aka: pointless.
Knowing the root causes for why you people-please might give you an indication of what behaviours you need to change to ease the depression/negative thinking. Now, the problem I have with this is: ""ok that's the reason/diagnosis/definition etc etc but what if this habit of people-pleasing and way of thinking is so ingrained that this pointless perspective I have is just who I really am?"" Then what? This kinda thinking is actually just rooted in the fact that I just over-think too much and it is in this instance that it is not serving me, it's not fulfilling me and if i want to get better then I have to stop that kind of thinking. If a habit is not serving you, stop and do the opposite. Obviously that's said easier than actually being done. I am a thinker and with that I can reason anything to make logical sense and I am in need of being constantly stimulated. (It sounds like you have the same ability which can also be our own 'disability'?) I can rationalise anything and anything results in pointlessness. And if that type of thinking is who I am then I need to accept it but not let it limit me.
But at the end of the day..these are all layers that need to be realised and then peeled back over time. For me, the severe lack of confidence, comparing myself to others with a perfectionist/idealist view and lacking pupose is what drives me to people-please and also makes me feel like a burden on others and ultimately feel like there is no point to life.
I think there are a few small-impact but effective steps to take that will slowly adjust your thinking that you're being a burden to others, depression & physical/mental tiredness. Eat well, sleep well and excercise. take natural seratonin. This is not the solution but it helps in the background while you're sorting out the more important issues. It's impossible to feel the way you do without reason. There has to be a reason. Yours is not the conventional reason of PTS, loss, finance, family disruption etc. Your reason will be something else that you have to ask yourself honestly and start fixing and building or healing that part of you.
Then to help the mental stimulation; do something that makes you and only you feel good on the inside. Keep yourself positively stimulated, do things that you'll be good at. It builds confidence and purpose over time. Usually helping others does the trick. or researching the things that genuinly interest you. Find activities that direct your over-thinking to something that's more productive for you. Surround yourself with people who think/talk like you that support you and build you back up. In this process you'll find who you are again, find that person that has been supressed in the process of people-pleasing. Surround yourself only with people who know that you lack self-confidence so they can build you up. Life is about relationships after all. (showing my bf how anxious i really was as a person was such a relief because he responded with ""i already know that's who you are, tell me how I can help you"" So instead of people-pleasing and connecting with everyone else on their level rather do things that re-connect yourself to you. You're tired because you've depleted yourself, put yourself down by saying you are a burden to others, said yes to others and no to yourself...that is tiring and so you need help to re-build youself up. live a fulfilling life like how you want it.
I hope that helps in someway. Your post has helped me realise a few things and reminded me that I'm doing the right thing for me at this point in my life..and I mean this in the most unselfish way but more of a survival and self-sustaining kinda way. Don't let yourself get so physically tired like i did, Chronic fatigue took 2 years of my life to recover. Re-energise slowly by making a few minor adjustments to thought processes and self-fulfillment.
I would like to know what you think about what i've said just in case I'm completey off-track and really need to re-evaluate my perspectives again.
Cheers,
Kelly.
p.s. From personal experience only: admitting you are depressed for no apparent reason helps and start the journey of finding the reason that has caused it. One is depressed because they have suppressed oneself and not fulfilled one's true self-expression. I don't think this requires meds but just incorportaing more self-expression rather than self-depression. Find ways to build up that confidence

"Thank you for your post. You write my own thoughts. Almost word for word.
1. Strong sense of fatigue.
2. Middling to poor social relationships. Sometimes none.
3. Best relationship with the dog. (He's a very nice dog)
4. Career/work not what I believe it should be.
5. From outside appearances, all appears functional and normal.
Either I'm overstimulated from everybody or depressed. Tried counselling and meds, but counselling indicates issues are normal part of life and I'm managing them and meds just make me sleepy (they did lower anxiety, I suppose), so I stopped.
I'd gladly take a year off and go for a walkabout. But no way (ethically) because I support two (nearly grown, but still needy) daughters a wife and ex-wife.
Should I turn off my ethical guidance?
Probably not.
I think I keep coming back to the same answers.
The skydiving therapy does spark my interest, however.

"Hey, umm I usually never give advice because I'm thirteen and you'll probably never get around to teading this but I felt that this needed to be said so I signed up for patient and decided to write this. I don't even think any human has ever actually benefited the planet, I dont mean the people but Earth as a whole and don't ever give up just because your struggle may seem hopeless at times just perseve and try and believe you can help do something that will help our planet. Now, no offense to you if you're Christian but I'm not going to drop a load of bs on God because I really don't believe that has ever benefitted anybody, but trust me I know how forsaken and just barren life can be and how sometimes people can make it worse but just remember that even I, a random stranger you'll probably never see or hear about wants you to be happy and see that brighter side of life that exists and that you should try to help other people that feel this same way as you so nobody could feel this way, and this sentence is horribly written and is way too long, but please don't ever give up. I really believe in you dude you can pull through so, umm I guess just pull through and help this world and help those around you and you'll see how people will smile and react to your caring influence. Best of luck my unknown friend!

"Well, this is not a follow up to anything, but a question. How do you bring yourself to believe that your life still has any purpose at 60, when you can't feel anything, There have been so many roadblocks to all your goals and dreams, that you just say, why try? There is not one single human being that actually gets any of what I experience, everyone is a minimizer, suck it up is the advice, so why even try, why get out of bed and try. Faking is hard work and it deplets you. Where to go from here?????

"I get it. Feeling nothing is good. Feeling as though you have been ripped apart and recognising at that age that your whole life has been based on a false assumption is even worse. Trust me I have had both and I much prefer the former. At least that's liveable - the second one isn't. People say thay being yourself is the only way to live your life, but what if being yourself is the cause and the result of your pain? Have you ever asked yourself that? Faking takes effort but at least you aren't hurt over and over again and living in hell.
People say seek help. What help? 6 months for waiting for an NHS appointment? It's all c..p. If you can't manage on your own in this life you might as well end it. Struggle, pain and still loneliness and stuck. No one cares. Why should you or I?

"I'm not even sure I have depression, I think this may just be 'me'.
I have always been pretty useless socially, but have had a normal upbringing, no horrible experiences, have gone through education fine and even got jobs but I've never enjoyed life, never really cared and normally feel like I'm not really worth anything and, inevitably enventually, will become a burden.
I'm not going to be dramatic and say I'm going to end it, it sounds so pathetic (no offence intended to anyone) but I have thoughts of 'going' or even dreams that I could die 'blamelessly' thorugh accident or illness. Selfish I know.
I have a cycle. Get job, put on confident easy going persona, get physically tired from doing that, lose energy to maintain job, focus on negative, leave job in some form (fired/quit). Friends are much the same, play easy going fun, can't keep it up, lose or push them away. Relationships, get attracted to ones who need help, help them in anyway I can, get to a point where I feel I am no more use so should go as they'd be ultimately better off.
So, currently I've quit my job as a teacher, couldn't take it - always something to improve and with my way of thinking that just sounds like constantly someone telling you you're useless (and it backing up your own thoughts anyway) but even though I liked aspects of my job I don't think I had a passion like I see in others. I felt I'd let everyone down so disappeared, my partner/ parents got me through immediate days after my sudden departure from work and saw Doc who was nice enough - put me on medication which seemed to do very little - even after a few months. In fact it only had negative side effects so about three weeks ago I stopped taking them completely. I also started seeing a CBT person about three/four session ago but this feels like it's doing nothing at all either, we talk, I'm honest as I can be but there is some element of being 'public' and putting on that face/ jokey responses.
I dip between a wish to not be around that is forever there and seems to be backed up with wholly logical reasons that people genuinely struggle to refute to absolutely crashing panic attacks/ given up when my 'theories' are proved.
I know this sounds odd, but I don't even have the will to get 'better', largely because I don't think I can. I am just 'me'. I am negative, boring and even if it is all just selffullfillng profecies - it's still me who has done that. I'm not blaming life, or others or anything else.
A lot of the posts I read on here seem to have good reason; PTS, loss, finances etc - does anyone have no 'good' reason?
I just feel I'm never going to be happy, I am soon to be much a burden on those around me (my gf) and that, in the long run, it'd be better for all if I just went. I know my family and gf love me - but time heals, life would get better and people move on. In the long run I'm sure it wouldn't effect my family and 100% sure my gf would be better off.
Not sure if there is an answer for this, just writing. I'm not angry, I'm not hurt, I'm not even sad as such, I'm just tired...

"This might sound very hard to believe, I've been around to many friends and family who feels like you or chmically depressed and more than that, I don't know why but I am feel like adding my advice but I thought I can share some of the success in my family after long time feeling like you do, don't feel bad those things happen for no reason too.
Well my suggestion and my experience from my loved once somwed me that having to look in to things that feel too much to do can sometime help.
Everyone who has/had depression managed to travell to a place where they can give so much for noting, like working abroad in sunshine country, the rewards are amazing, take off time from work, Sabatical leave for a year to travell the world, if you can't affored to do that, work for NGO in Africa, South Amarica, India, the list goes on, there will be ajustment needed but its so much exciting to see the world and help others, if you don't like it you can come back, few people I know in my family benefit from this things, now most us help and get paid to do what we love to do, the depresson or been unhappy life style here in Western country is for a reason. Simple life style with reward can be much bigger happier feeling than routin life.
Just saying, i am not professional I just have my own experiene, I live in London, so many people from my community become depressed here in UK, for no reason, they have a job, family love, friends and good social life if they wanted too but they seem to be happy when they go back to help and work.
Job isn't hard to find in a developing country as skills are in demands, or work for charity organisation where they can cover basic expence then give back & see the world, i garanty you you will have such diffirent approch to life.

Cant get my head around why anyone would create a body so complicated ,its to much of a struggle. must say learned a lot through negative experience,and had some happy times. I dont think anyone can answer the question as to why we are here ,or meaning for that matter. understand where you are everything seems pointless ,everyone is suffering in some way ,the point of life realy DONT KNOW

I am really sorry to hear you are feeling like this and although you may not believe so you can always find some way to get better I dont know what it is but I always feel drained and have no motivation to try anymore. I know how you feel when you say you think your boring and negative and socially useless and thats when I find it hard to understand why the only 2 friends I have would even want to know me. It was hard to read the part where you said it wouldnt effect your family 100% because even not knowing your family I know they would be more than devestated. I think I can relate to where your coming from so please just know that nobody would be better off without you and I imagine you are extremly loved I hope I didnt offend you in any way and I hope you will feel better.

"Hi their I know this post is quite old but I've recently just stumbled across it because I'm struggling with pretty much the very same thing you have described in this post and it has resonated with me so much that I couldn't have described my problem any better myself. I'm very similiar in that I'm tired with life, of pretending to feel a certain way, to appear confident or happy when you really aren't and then just feeling like what's the point. I used to have passion before with art and was creative and depression struck me and after that I've just constantly been fighting to get my old self back again.
I know my story is slightly different than yours as I have suffered depression prior and that has brought on these feelings but I really feel for you as I understand, and ultimately just wanted to know how you havec coped and have you found a way to feel more at peace with yourself? I'm constantly always trying to push myself to do what I used to love but then feel tired time and time again. Would love to hear your response.

"Hi it's not changing who you are as a person. Counselling helps you to understand and explore issues in a safe place and will help you to see things from a different angle. You will learn to understand your motivations and see where negative thoughts and feeling come from.
It's not you who needs to change per se but some of your behaviour might have to otherwise you might never get better. x

"I've just signed up for this forum and came across your post which I see is from over a year ago, Wow... How it resonated with me, you have put into words what I have felt for years but have never been able to fully express to anyone (family and freinds just don't seem to get it). It's not to say that I'm never happy or that I am miserable all day every day, those fleeting ""happy moments"" do grace me with their presence now and again, my problem is that I feel undeserving of being happy. I push the people that care for me away (the whole being a burden aspect) and in my experience there is ultimately going to be some or other disappointment and I am not emotionally equipped to deal with constant disappointments. I am not an emotional person, no typical tears and break downs... Instead, I bottle EVERYTHING up, push people away and end up hurting the ones that care for me (my family, friends, ex-boyfriends), I've become a bit of a loner because I feel I don't want to pull other people into the silent mess I feel I have become. My mind works over-time, 24/7, I over-think and over-analyze everything and I beat myself up for being... Me.
I was dating someone, we were together for 3 years and as much as he drove me crazy, I managed to open myself up and fall hopelessly in love... But as the story goes, I always felt he was too good for me. Over the duration of the 3 years, I sabotaged my own happiness, picked unnecessary fights and ultimately pushed him away, or forced him to leave should I say. Family and friends are always so willing to offer their support and be a shoulder to cry on etc but I slap that fake smile on and pretend I am just fine (fake it till you make it).
The past couple of months I have been going out with friends, trying to get some semblance of ""normality"" back and on a handful of those occassions I ended up having a bit too much to drink. It almost feels as if there is this other person inside of me that comes, I'm fun and jovial, loveable and flirtatious (obviously the lowering of inhibitions), I dance and drink and have a relatively good time. The problem is that I then wake up the next day with a bit of memory loss and assume I've embarrassed myself to the highest degree, spend a week or 2 thereafter beating myself up for being so stupid and wishing the world would swallow me up.
Everything just feels like a vicious cycle and I've put myself on auto pilot, just going through the motions from day to day and not really living despite the fact that I am alive.

Before you can be completely content and happy with yourself you have to love yourself first and I haven't always loved myself and that goes for being in a relationship as well
Before you can truly love someone you have to love yourself and be content with yourself as well
i am 52 years old and for years I've felt worthless and so unhappy
I'm not entirely happy but I've accepted life for the way it is
No one can make you happy til you make yourself happy does that make sense?
I have daughters I don't see nor talk to anymore and why?
My youngest daughter has wished me dead and has threatened to hurt me and why?
She is mentally retarded and bi polar that does not excuse her actions
My other daughter the last time I saw her was about 4-5 years ago she was in a mental hospital for being emotionally and mentally disturbed
And I was good to my kids and use to blame myself but realized it wasn't my fault
I wish you the best and will keep you in my prayers ok

"I can't help but identify with this, to a bizarre proximity, to the point of almost being able to copy and paste half of it into my own words.
I too have always been pretty useless socially, perhaps in part due to my abilility to see people's true feelings despite their words, and to pick up on and reflect their own insecurities. People don't seem to like this!
I too had a normal upbringing, without any damaging experiences or reasons for my inability to function in life like everyone else.
I too have gone through education easily and i have a high level of intelligence. This is not self-importance nor vanity; my entire family are highly intelligent and they are all high-acheivers.
But I too have never enjoyed life, and have always felt that it was more tiring than it was enjoyable. I have never felt that anything I did I ever really cared about.
I have always felt like I am a fake, an imposter, that I'm not really worth anything, and that I do not deserve to burden anyone by asking them for anything.
I would kill myself except that I have no particular wish to die. I don't enjoy living in any way, but death seems to me to be a waste, as well as that fact that i do not wish to hurt my family, and to be entirely frank I'm not exactly sure that what may come after would be any improvement.
I have the same feeling of always having to keep up a front, never being genuine, nor revealing myself to others. I can see beneath their skins, yet no one seems to see beneath what i wish them to. It is so exausting trying keep it all up, and yet i am incapable of dropping it.
I am seeing a psychotherapist intermittently, but it so tiring that i find myself giving up on it. I cannot even drop the front with them, no matter how honest I am.
I can't go on and my life is crumbling. I barely leave the house anymore and my life has ground to a halt. I cycle between momentary episodes of tremendous hope, as I imagine a possible future of normalacy, which vanish as I realise how fleeting my vigour is, and reality comes crashing down on me, threating to leave me numb to everything.
And now i prepare to be dismissed as overly melodramatic, mentally unstable, ignorant or unintelligant.

"Hello rsjg
I know how you feel because I have the same feelings (always have had) I'm 62 now and still feeling the same way.
You could try - this is what I do in order to make live a little less futile - take in a couple of shelter animals and give them the best life that you can.
Unfortunately you cannot change the world, you cannot change your view of the world but you can change the world for them - it also gives you someone to love and someone to get up for in the morning.
Do not think for one minute that you are a 'burden' for you are not - I think you need someone to live for - you cannot expect that from a human being as that is too much for them to bear - but an animal is quite happy to bear the burden of being your reason for living.
I hope the above helps it's how I keep going.

"My friend,
Life is not the meaning of knowing how perfect any human being could be. We all are imperfect being by default. Some became more imperfect by trying to fix the problem of one's own life . Where as some are suffering to find solution for other. Life cannot teach a single person to be perfect through man made 7 tips to be perfect. Therefore, I believe that this world itself is imperfect, and no human being who is from down can fix the problem of this world. Every person is searching or seeking some one to fix one's own life problem. In nutshell how can we be happy, Happy is not to withdraw oneself from the norms of the life or to withdraw from the society. Read new/old literature you will find that people thought to be become perfect. But honesty is no one is too perfect to make some body perfect being. But the truth is no one can find the answers of all the problems of the earth. So seek the wisdom from above and look into the whole humanity, I tell you no person from the earth could fix his/her problem. But donot be disappointed and depraved by isolating yourself from the whole community. But look up and find there is only one who came from up can fix the problem of your innerbeing becasue he came from above and can live within you. If you search that truth from the bottom of your heart. He is quite near to you and lives within you. I am talking about the truth that can set you free.Why you are suffering and not seeking the help from above.Once the strength and wisdom is poured to you from above, only then you will find the resourecs from within the world system.... medication, professional health. Don't look for the friends of Job. Go into the society and find any person who loved are is still living who is/was 100% perfect. My personal proposal for you is first seek within yourself, know yourself and look for the one whose name is above all names.

"I'm not even sure I have depression, I think this may just be 'me'.
I have always been pretty useless socially, but have had a normal upbringing, no horrible experiences, have gone through education fine and even got jobs but I've never enjoyed life, never really cared and normally feel like I'm not really worth anything and, inevitably enventually, will become a burden.
I'm not going to be dramatic and say I'm going to end it, it sounds so pathetic (no offence intended to anyone) but I have thoughts of 'going' or even dreams that I could die 'blamelessly' thorugh accident or illness. Selfish I know.
I have a cycle. Get job, put on confident easy going persona, get physically tired from doing that, lose energy to maintain job, focus on negative, leave job in some form (fired/quit). Friends are much the same, play easy going fun, can't keep it up, lose or push them away. Relationships, get attracted to ones who need help, help them in anyway I can, get to a point where I feel I am no more use so should go as they'd be ultimately better off.
So, currently I've quit my job as a teacher, couldn't take it - always something to improve and with my way of thinking that just sounds like constantly someone telling you you're useless (and it backing up your own thoughts anyway) but even though I liked aspects of my job I don't think I had a passion like I see in others. I felt I'd let everyone down so disappeared, my partner/ parents got me through immediate days after my sudden departure from work and saw Doc who was nice enough - put me on medication which seemed to do very little - even after a few months. In fact it only had negative side effects so about three weeks ago I stopped taking them completely. I also started seeing a CBT person about three/four session ago but this feels like it's doing nothing at all either, we talk, I'm honest as I can be but there is some element of being 'public' and putting on that face/ jokey responses.
I dip between a wish to not be around that is forever there and seems to be backed up with wholly logical reasons that people genuinely struggle to refute to absolutely crashing panic attacks/ given up when my 'theories' are proved.
I know this sounds odd, but I don't even have the will to get 'better', largely because I don't think I can. I am just 'me'. I am negative, boring and even if it is all just selffullfillng profecies - it's still me who has done that. I'm not blaming life, or others or anything else.
A lot of the posts I read on here seem to have good reason; PTS, loss, finances etc - does anyone have no 'good' reason?
I just feel I'm never going to be happy, I am soon to be much a burden on those around me (my gf) and that, in the long run, it'd be better for all if I just went. I know my family and gf love me - but time heals, life would get better and people move on. In the long run I'm sure it wouldn't effect my family and 100% sure my gf would be better off.
Not sure if there is an answer for this, just writing. I'm not angry, I'm not hurt, I'm not even sad as such, I'm just tired...

"Don't know why I'm writing about this and really don't know how I found my way here . But I read your story of life and feeling down and pretty much a future burden on loved ones and I have the exact problems I felt like I could of wrote it word for word . I hope for better days everyday I wake up and want positiveness and try to fight negativity but it consumes me always and my persona of looking happy and not all messed up around my loved ones has taken a toll on my mind and body . It's hard to please everyone and even if u can they can never get the true purpose of why. Respect honor friendship with no judgement on talk and being out going .i have lost a lot of things in life big house nice trucks properties . Went through a divorce and went from wakeing up everyday and seeing my beautiful daughters as they woke up and being with them every moment of there life , to seeing them every weekend if I'm not to busy at work seeing them dureing week putting up a persona and a good environment every time there with me it is so hard . I lost my nephew to hit n run driver at same time as my divorce and I have never recover from either really . But my depression or whatever it is keeps me in solitude I want no contact with anymore people than I have to , and it is sad because I love most people and look for honor and respect . Maybe to much sometimes , these feelings have been with me for as long as I can remember even as a teenager and they have become out of control I would say now that I am older . Don't want pity or anything just hard to wake up tomorrow and put my mask on only to take it off before days end . Hope for better feelings about life and helping others .

"My goodness me, for the first time in my life I have found someone able to articulate my exact same feelings. It's like an emptiness, a lack of drive, not a sadness as such, just complete lack of purpose. And as you so rightly say, all the imprecations of others, like looking at your blessings etc, have the opposite effect. Makes us feel even worse about moaning or complaining. I don't have an answer, and i very much doubt that there IS an answer. At least I know now that I am not alone. Thank you.

"I have been afflicted with these feelings and issues for the vast majority of my life. I find myself falling into the same self defeating patterns that you describe and having a lackluster outlook on life and living in general. But I remember the times when I was happy, the times when things seemed to make sense and feel right. There were certain conditions being met in all of those circumstances, not all at once or in any particular order but those conditions were as follows.
1. Doing something constructive with a tangible and productive outcome.
2. Doing something that immidiately benifeits myself or someone I care about.
3. Doing something that has lasting positive benifeits and effects on my own living conditions or those of someone I care about.
4. Doing something new and challenging that I beleive will lead to tangible positive effects for myself and or others.
After analyizing these conditions for happyness in me I realized that these are the things that human beings are meant to do. We are meant to seek personal or familial enrichment through hard work and adventure seeking. In the days of our ancestors when the work that you did gave a direct result of how good your life was it was easy to find fulfillment. When we were able to strike out into the world and make it as we saw fit with our own 2 hands and imaginations for ourselvs and our loved ones we were fulfilling our purpose and thus had no reason to be depressed. It is this modern societal construct that is failing us, Human beings were not meant to live in this way! We were not meant to be shackled by any rules, laws and obligations that we did not choose for ourselves! I want to point at a horizon and go as far and as fast as i can in that direction then settle down any damn place i please to nurture myself and my family! I want to learn about anything that takes my interest simply by watching/listening and trying! That is the freedom we are meant to have and THAT is the only way of life that will make a healthy human being! Untill these great societies of ours recognizes these basic human needs whe will continue to circle the drain and more and more people will grow ravenous as these needs continue to go unsatisfied untill eventually it will all collapse in chaos and people are FORCED to live in those ways simply to survive and to rebuild, just like our ancestors.

"Hi,
I'm not going to sugarcoat. Here is the truth based on my experience: you are not going to find happiness or what you are looking for. I didn't. After reading all your posts, I see that you are a little similar to me in how you feel. But I'm in much worse situation. The older we get, the worse it gets.
I have searched every option, and found no solution. I think it is in genes. Depression will stay till we are breathing. So based on my experience, there is no way to get out of this. The only things I found that would take me, for few hours or short time, out of this miserable situation are the no-no stuff that knocks one out. Life is meaningless, boring, depressive, and unfair.

"At the beginning of 2016 I met someone and fell in love with her. The year has been the best of my miserable life. In December an old boyfriend arrived uninvited at the door and her reaction to him disturbed me in the sense that she was obviously not over this previous relationship.
Later in December her 33 year old daughter who lives a distance away started verbally and emotionally abusing her mother. This developed to the point where my partner was completely traumatised by the constant abuse.
I suggested, as did other friends and family, that the daughter get help from a professional. My partner seemed reluctant to admit that her daughter may have a mental issue but eventually suggested to her that she would go to where she lives and help her to get the help she needs. Eventually that is what happened.
My story in all of this is that I have been divorced three times previously and had numerous relationships - all fairly short (around a year). Five of those ended as a result of a child, albeit they were all adults, and over the years I have felt more and more useless as a partner. I have always been banned from interfering.
I am now living with my eldest son and his partner which is hardly ideal but it is a roof over my head. I cannot imaging going on like this and since I have had all sorts of health issues myself for which cardio and chest investigations have been done without any result I really cannot see any reason myself staying on this earth for any longer.
It is as if my time here is spent and I wish something would happen to end it all. I do not have the courage to try suicide.
I am very angry about how this last relationship ended as there was nothing we could do about it. I feel totally dead inside.

"Nothing changes, just my ability to pretend things are fine. The thought processes remain each and every day. I am all I ever thought I was. Some days I will ignore it better than others but it's always there.
Which is why I rarely post on here any more. I am no poster boy for success.
Life hasn't improved, I still can't function as 'normal' and try to continue finding a route which just about suffices whilst continually making me feel half complete. I can't hold a job so take temporary ones but therefore can't be what I feel I need to be (financially stable, a non-burden on those around me) - I find short term solutions to long term problems but kind of know, deep down, that I will inevitably reach a D Day and will be unlikely see old age. That in itself is some comfort.
So I apologise for not giving a better answer. I wish I could give you a more positive spin. But in a world in which I see ever more proof that to succeed you need to be selfish then perhaps I was never cut out for humanity anyway.
I am in a vicious circle largely of my own making or thought processes but it does not change the reality and such is my age that it is now impossible for me to repair the damage I, or my mind, has done to my life.
Mmm, maybe I should stop writing today. Good luck with your own journeys. Take solace in the belief that I am hopefully not typical. If you can find your cause you have hope of fixing it. If you have not messed stuff up because of it then hopefully things can get better from here. I have seen, and spoken to a few people, who have been at very very low points and gone on to have very successful and, more importantly, happy lives.
But there is no one fix. I just hope you find yours.

"Hi rsjg
I didn't think I'd find my psychological doppelganger (or perhaps I'm yours), but indeed here you are and after having read your posts up until the very recent ones I can most certainly relate.
Man, it's insane how accurately your descriptions of how you feel line up with how I've been feeling for years and the cloud was especially thick tonight which is how I ended up here. The irony is not lost on me that all of a sudden I'm excited and gained a burst of energy knowing that I'm not alone in feeling so incredibly listless most days and 'apathetic' too as one user described it.
I can say I've been blessed in my life with an incredible, loving (though imperfect as all are) family and extended family as well as a pretty good upbringing with good opportunities...but like you I feel useless for the most part and have no desire for life really. I've managed to hold a job for a number of years, although it has been my first proper one out of varsity - but even so the feelings have never left completely, I have perhaps one or two close friends I still keep in contact with otherwise my closest friends are my family, my male cousins and my older sister. I've gone deeper in my faith and committed to going to church every Sunday with my Mom and older sister and have been doing so for about a year and a half - a major feat as I'm not one of those disciplined folk at all though I've made a decision to treat it like I treat my job, get up and go despite your feelings and desire to sleep in - it always ends up being beyond rewarding and incredibly uplifting.
I can't say I have any answers because I feel exactly the same way as you, but I've been feeding my mind and spirit with not just general positive stuff, but what I feel is truth to me - sifting through the superficial fortune cookie quotes and delving deeper to get to the heart of what is true, it really has brought a change in perspective at least for me. It just gets hard every day, getting up in the morning you feel somewhat ready to take on the day, but then the cloud catches up and you're back under it wondering why you bothered waking up at all, by the evening I feel like a zombie, drained and defeated once more.
I don't know, I keep praying about it and am experiencing more of the authentic joy buried deep inside - I savour it when it appears, but I know exactly how you feel.
If all else fails, good honest instrumental music always seems to cut through my conscious mind no matter my emotional state and hits me straight in my subconscious (like how a good or a bad smell almost immediately can stir up memories or feelings) - it almost forces a smile out of me and the sun then breaks through the clouds if only for a little while...the takeaway here being that of being present in that moment, it gives me hope of something more if only for a short while.
I guess I'm also aching for purpose, for a reason (or my reason) for being here, breathing. Like you. I'm also looking for answers as to why I find it hard to maintain relationships, why I care so little about what other people care so much about, why I lack ambition, why I feel inferior and defeated most of each and every day, why I'm so afraid, why I bother even going through the motions when I also think any friend or potential partner that shows as much interest in me as I do them will eventually leave when they get to know the real me...my last gf did and that was 8 years ago.
Well, that went grey pretty quick jeez, lol. Anyway perhaps just this very act of sharing is enough to keep hope alive...like a support group of sorts...I'll leave you with a verse that

Friends are much the same, play easy going fun, can't keep it up, lose or push them away. Relationships, get attracted to ones who need help, help them in anyway I can, get to a point where I feel I am no more use so should go as they'd be ultimately better off.
So, currently I've quit my job as a teacher, couldn't take it - always something to improve and with my way of thinking that just sounds like constantly someone telling you you're useless (and it backing up your own thoughts anyway) but even though I liked aspects of my job I don't think I had a passion like I see in others. I felt I'd let everyone down so disappeared, my partner/ parents got me through immediate days after my sudden departure from work and saw Doc who was nice enough - put me on medication which seemed to do very little - even after a few months. In fact it only had negative side effects so about three weeks ago I stopped taking them completely. I also started seeing a CBT person about three/four session ago but this feels like it's doing nothing at all either, we talk, I'm honest as I can be but there is some element of being 'public' and putting on that face/ jokey responses.
I dip between a wish to not be around that is forever there and seems to be backed up with wholly logical reasons that people genuinely struggle to refute to absolutely crashing panic attacks/ given up when my 'theories' are proved.
I know this sounds odd, but I don't even have the will to get 'better', largely because I don't think I can. I am just 'me'. I am negative, boring and even if it is all just selffullfillng profecies - it's still me who has done that. I'm not blaming life, or others or anything else.
A lot of the posts I read on here seem to have good reason; PTS, loss, finances etc - does anyone have no 'good' reason?
I just feel I'm never going to be happy, I am soon to be much a burden on those around me (my gf) and that, in the long run, it'd be better for all if I just went. I know my family and gf love me - but time heals, life would get better and people move on. In the long run I'm sure it wouldn't effect my family and 100% sure my gf would be better off.
Not sure if there is an answer for this, just writing. I'm not angry, I'm not hurt, I'm not even sad as such, I'm just tired...

"Hi,
80% of your thoughts are matching to mine.
Even i feel the same.
I don't know where i am heading too.
Confused mind with always options and finally end with not choosing either.
Sometimes feel like to go some where far away from people.
But alone and i dont need a company either.
I have a good family and girlfriend whom i always feel annoyed. It's very difficult to understand a girl and what actually runs in their mind.
At first i was searching reasons to talk to her and now searching reasons to avoid talking to her.
I don't know what exactly i am doing....!

"I felt the same way for the past 20 years, its like I am watching a very long and boring movie, which I know the ending for it and yet everyone around me is forcing me to keep watching it. Its like I am watching a bad magic show and I know how all the tricks are done. The worst thing is when you talk to the ""professionals"" and they keep spouting the same patronizing crap and you keep biting your tong because you do want them to label you or medicate you, which could ruin your kids chances of getting your life insurance payout if you deiced to leave the movie before it finishes.
I feel the same way you do, I had a reasonably good life, traveled, got a wonderful family, PhD, etc... I just can't shake the feeling that none of this matters. Who the hell are we to ask the most arrogant question ""Why are we here?"" who the hell do we think we are.
It was luck that helped us develop large brains and dominate the planet, there are endless other possibilities of how things could have gone for Mankind!
I really believe that this is our ""Cocoon"" and once we break out and release the true ""Us"", we will reach our real potential or move on to the next stage of evolution.
Why should death be scary? We are born and its beautiful! We become children and it beautiful! We get married and it beautiful! We have children and it Beautiful !We have grandchildren and it Beautiful! Why cant our death be beautiful!?
I attended a couple of Maori funerals in New Zealand, all we did for a WEEK, was drink, eat and celebrate the life of the departed. Many other societies have the same Idea and many of them existed for over 20+ thousand years. But NOOOOOO! We the ""civilized"" ones (with a few hundred years under our belt) must live as long as possible to pay more taxes, to buy houses, to finance wars, and keeps governments and useless public servants (including me when I was one) in their jobs. And the majority of them, do not have enough sense to think of 1% of what we are discussing here.
Please do not tell me how lucky I am and to look at the less fortunate, I was borne in a refugee camp! and I lived there until 10 years of age. I remember having nothing and being happy because I didn't any better , It is a 100 times worse to have more than many and still be ""JOYLESS!"", it adds a new layer of guilt for every single thing that should make you happy and your are not.
I think what we experience is part of the human experience, natural and everything else we do is the unnatural part. Plus the only reason ""Professionals"" and ""Governments"" pretend to care, is because its their chosen career and to make sure that there are more cattle in the farm ( the cattle are us).
I'm going to stick around for as long as I feel like it, but when I deiced that I had enough, I will leave in the calmest, cleanest and most polite way possible as not to inconvenience others by my decision.

"It's very sad reading all these comments. I hope you all get better and find happiness. You all deserve it too. I'm in the same situation but I have good reason. Everything is against me. It's not only the depression, the nervous breakdowns, GAD, Agoraphobia, Social Phobia, Social Anxiety, PTSD. I suspect BPD too. All the problems I have revolve around people and me. How can I live when I can't even be near anyone?Even my own family which hurts me. I wish I had a career, etc. Everything everyone does but instead I'm stuck in my house letting the time pass me by. Just wasting time I shouldn't think about it so much I don't have anything to lose. All my problems have caused my misery since I was 4. I don't have a furture. I don't want a present either. I want my pain to go away. I want to be like everyone else. Functional and social. Useful. But instead I'm stuck in my bed I no longer get out of it. I'm all day in it. Even when I get up I get dizzy and feel I will collapse. Anyways I really hope you all get better and are still hanging on.🙌🙏💖

"I feel very similar to you a lot. I do have a few things in my life that are out of my control and suck a bag right now...but not like anyone is dying. I do want to do things and want to make friends. I have a husband but he doesn't really understand me and he is a part of some of my ""out of my control"" issues...but There are many more. A brief and complex list goes something like this..I apparently can't hold down any friendships and now I don't really want to, I never cared about becoming someone or having the drive to have a career till I was 29 and am now screwed bc I know nothing yet want to know, and I am the laziest 110lb girl in the universe yet want to move. I'm a an enigma. My dad made a quote up about me a while ago saying ""the only thing consistent with Becca is that she is always inconsistent"". ..it's pretty accutate and he is a psychiatric social worker (yet he is his own piece of work.) I have been depressed since 6th grade. I am 31 now. It was in remission for a while and kind of turned in to anxiety as I got older. It's now leading back to a depressive state. It's kind of like my brain and body want two different things. Although I have a gimpy knee, my body is a little ball of energy that can hardly stay still....bit my brain says, ""No, sit down and sleep, bc what's the point."" I'm not trying to be an ass but sometimes tupac has it right...why am I fighting to live when I'm just living to die! It's not like I want to die...quite frankly it's a bit terrifying, but I do want mental peace. Instead of picturing me taking my own life I kind of just picture myself hanging in space orbiting around my own planet. Idk, I look pretty normal and plain but I am a really odd bird. I Think about what people must have done in previous times when life was a lot more simple, but perhaps they were more happy because they just kept busy and they didn't have the option to sit and mope. I really like tv because it's distracting. I finally did something to help me with my drive to become someone, but its probably going to fail.....and then what??? I never ever wanted self-worth before.. I kind of just accepted myself for who I was, pretty much a plain old nobody. But now I'm trying to better my situation and what if that goes wrong..I'm back to being a plain old nobody. I don't know where to focus or emphasize importance. I have been souls searching since I was 10 really and I like myself..i think I could be nicer to family, but other then that I am okay with being a hater and for not keeping up with the Kardashians. I try to find solace in nature, but a storms always a brewing. I often say to myself, ""okay make the most of any situation and your here now so may as well enjoy yourself bc no one is going to make you happy except you and you have one life."" That's kind of my mantra, and also very true, bc often people make me very sad...especially the ones closest to me. Anything can help.. Butler? Any words?

"Hey there. There is no proper solution to this as such but I believe that it is your thought process which needs change. You should talk about your problem to someone close to you or maybe vent it out by writing or engaging into some activity which requires expressing oneself such as acting or singing etc. It is good that you understand that life ahead is going to be beautiful, but what you also need to have at the moment is patience and don't lose hope. Maybe this is why after having gone through medications and therapies, you are not able to recover from your condition. I recently consulted an online forum called eWellness Expert. They have psychologists with wide experience in their field who can help you, if you require professional help. Hope this helps. Take care

"Mmm. I'm not sure how to reply to this. I've cut back on my responses on here as the thread seems to have taken on almost a community of its own - a place for people to say they feel similar and get responses. I read every post but feel I am far from a poster boy for success - quite the reverse.
?I would absolutely love it I could say yes I am much more upbeat but I'm not sure where you get that from! My last response to a message three months ago basically stated nothing changes. I re-read my first post and a handful of ones I've written in response to others over the years and couldn't think of one thing that I feel differently about. Still tired, still a burden, still all the things I think about myself.
?Some days are better than others, some days I can act 'normally' and no-one would notice. Other days I just hideaway. My most overriding feeling of the last few months has not been of anger, sadness or anything other than tiredness, just like I want to close my eyes, lie back and never wake up. I've sat on the edge of my bed, taken a few deep breaths, closed my eyes and just wished that it was that calm and easy to disappear.
?I still have no 'job' other than day to day stuff which is very unreliable. I still have zero friends, I still have zero social life (obvious really!) and still feel a disconnect from my family. I still feel like my gf would be better without me.
?So that's why I don't really respond on here, because I'm not sure I can really advise anyone or help you with questions like you put directly to me - nothing did it for me, I doubt anything ever will.
Sorry.

"I agree with you about your post rsjg. I have never known a post to be this long before!
I think the good news for you is that you are still here so you are getting through life somehow 3 years later. I still think counselling would help you but it wouldn't be easy and it would be long term.
Just a thought - you say you had a normal childhood? I did too in the sense that I was physically harmed or from a broken home or anything, but what I didn't realise for many years was that I was suffering from Childhood Emotional Abuse until I googled Childhood Emotional Neglect. Suddenly many things made sense as CEN isn't about what was done it is about what wasn't done.
If interested have a look at it. I got most of my info from Psych Central. It might ring some bells for you too. x

"I can't believe I found your post. By all accounts I have a great life and great husband but relate completely to ""I'm just tired"". How are you now? What are you doing these days? I'm having a hard time with the point to it all and somehow came across this post as searching for painless suicide methods. I just feel like I exist. I don't see a counselor or take any meds. I'm not addicted to drugs or alcohol, I have not been abused. I have fun sometimes, I laugh sometimes but, I'm just tired. Let me know how you're doing.

"My 'status' is of no help or relevance to you. But you sound like you need help so maybe your first point of call should be a doctor.
You may find that it's an easy fix for you if someone professional looks at it - I'm not sure how long you've felt the way you do or anything but something's can be simply chemical deficiencies that are easily rectified. If you go to a doctor and still don't have any solutions then maybe this kind of forum may help.
But if you're feeling that low now and have never sought help before, the doctors should be accessed immediately. Explore all options before you give up. Good luck.

"I'll keep this short, but as you asked me directly I feel it only right to reply. I think it was the word 'cry' that caught my attention - I've been so accepting and calm about my inadequacies that I haven't cried in years...that's probably slightly odd!
In answer yes, no, not sure! Very little has changed since the first post all those years ago. Sometimes I want to sleep forever, other days I feel better but it's still there in the back of my mind at all times. I'm not sure, if I were ever asked directly, whether I would ever say I was happy - it's more what degree I'm fighting myself today.
But please don't take this as a direct response to your own issues. We're all different. Start your own thread and see if you can find any answers or actions that can help you.
I wish you all the luck in the world.

"Today was definitely one of those days of which you describe.even though I don’t have them as frequently, they happen seemingly out of nowhere.
Sometimes I am able to control the thoughts after years of reading self help books and trying various late 1970’s workshops to get “it”. Nothing helped, and at one point in my early 20’s I was afraid to be alone and afraid to be with people.
At 36 , I had a child and a husband, which gave me a measure of security. My mother, father, and sister never lived to see my child. I was very close to my mother, and she died the year before I met my husband. Then a second daughter arrived two years later in 1992.
I have officially been an empty nester since 2014 , the year my younger daughter finished school and took off for Boulder.
My husband is an excellent father, but with that, he’s much rather see our kids than ever have quality time with me. He’s not at all romantic. I have friends , but many are living retired with their husbands. My husband is in biotech and plans to work for at least another year and a half.
I was struck by your mention of helping people. I , too, like to help people . I feel most significant when I am helping my friends, but at the same time , I don’t want then to not feel better so I’ll feel needed. Ironically, I’m therapist to every one of my friends.
But back to you, when I read your entry, I felt such a kinship. I know that feeling of futility in the game of life. Sometimes you can navigate the waters and float. It’s not great, but at least there’s no undertow.
I’d like to feel some passion for something. Anything that would permit “ flow”, but sometimes there are no avenues. I’m seeing my weekly therapist tomorrow, and quite frankly, I’m tired of that , too. For a couple of months I did neurofeedback, which I thought was helping, but now, I don’t know. What is CBT?
I guess write if you feel like it. I don’t know if it helps to know I feel very similar to you. It helped me to read your comment, because I thought “ oh, I’m not the only one”. I wish us peace , inspiration, and enthusiasm. Good luck, and I’m pretty sure you’d be missed if you weren’t around.

"It's beautiful that we all post comments here and share our experiences. You wrote that you feel very similar to poster and I very much do as well. I have friends that I used to do stuff with (hiking. Camping etc. ) I just don't anymore. Sometimes looking someone I know in the eye I can sense that they feel I'm not my old energetic outgoing self and I don't know how to change it. I tell a friend or two I can trust that I'm not feeling great, and I always hear basically to suck it up. I don't know how many people on here have constant repetitive thoughts , but I'm tired of it. The only relief is work since I need to focus , but I'm not feeling myself at all. I'm just treading water. I don't want to be here in this place. I own my own home outright. Very very little debt. I'm still relatively young (44). Good 9-5 job. Never work weekends. and here I am. I don't understand it, but whatever.
I keep thinking of insignificant things that wouldn't bother your average person. And it's impossibly lately to make it stop. I just seem to relive over and over stupid moments that in my mind I could have said something different or behaved in a different way. And almost as though I set myself up for failing down the road I sense doom sometimes. Not a good feeling. I haven't taken meds and this current bout was almost like a nervous breakdown. I'm the past due to relationships etc. I've had depressing moments, but nothing like this. I wonder what I have that finally came in so suddenly and gripped me?

"I don't know if you still receive these comments but thought I would reply regardless.
I'm sorry you have so much perceived failure in your life. Reading your post, it sounds like you try so hard, so hard that you are affecting an image that isn't your own. This in itself is exhausting and of course it leads to a sense of failure. How can you be this appearance you aspire to be?
As most of us do, you seem to place a lot of emphasis on your relationships with others, and how much of a burden you may be to them. Above all though, it seems like you perceive yourself as a burden from the outset. If you believe this then, at least in your own eyes, this is what you will become.
I'm sorry the medication didn't work. don't let this experience write off medication entirely. It may be that you haven't found the right medicine yet. Not that that is the solution, but it can provide a helping step on the way.
You also mentioned how you try to be easy going and fun around friends but this is exhausting. You don't need to be easy going and fun. Whoever said that these are the virtues we need to embody? There are many out there who appreciate far more the qualities of self-knowledge, humility and even self-doubt. It's what we all feel, to greater or lesser degrees, though most try to hide it.
In the long term, I am as certain as I can be of anything that it would hurt your family. Not guilt-trip, but it seems that these thighs stem from a lack of self-worth.
Please don't take how you feel about yourself for an objective reality, and please don't imagine that you're of any less value than the rest of us. Don't imagine that you have to be a certain way for people to care about you and certainly don't put up any pretence about who you are.
Being 'fun' and 'easy-going' are underrated anyway I hope life is improving for you and you don't feel you need to put up so many appearances.
Take care

"I do read, I rarely reply these days. Not much I can attempt to disagree with in your words but, seeing as you took the time, it would be rude not to acknowledge my appreciation for your efforts.
Everything you say is true. But thinking it and believing it/ living it are very different worlds! I do wonder, whether self inflicted or not, that such thoughts eventually become so ingrained in ones psyche that you become that person anyway. So even if I wasn't what I profess to be at the start, such is the mindset that I have now become that person beyond all repute. There is little denying the burden I have become.
But anyway, thanks for your words. I shall try to remember them in the hope that one day, if even for a brief moment, I can believe them.

"I feel the same way I just feel there is no point in living. I always pretend that I'm fine with others because no one really understands me and I feel that I'm all alone in this world.

"You have kids, always a reason to carry on. I'd never have kids because of that responsibility but if you have kids you owe them to fight. My partner might well be able to find someone better, but your kids will never get a new Dad. I think other family are different; you don't have a responsibility to them but kids you do. There's no way they're better off without you around. So if nothing else, just remember your kids everytime the thought crosses your mind. Good luck.

Not sure if there is an answer for this, just writing. I'm not angry, I'm not hurt, I'm not even sad as such, I'm just tired...

"I am a ghost, a shell. I no longer know who I am, or care for that matter. I exist in the world as an observer. I am neither happy, nor sad, I just am. I am talented, yet derive no enjoyment from my skills. I don’t like people, and hate to engage in shallow small talk. I have an amazing gf, a kind and loving soul that works tirelessly to help me see the bright side of life, and I do try. She is such an inspiration to me, I wish I could be just like her, but alas, I am confined to a bland existence in my own mind. I feel my life ended some time ago, yet my body persists. I don’t indulge in drugs or alcohol, exercise, seek help with physical and mental issues, yet deep down there is a deep rooted belief that everything is pointless. I have taken the maximum dosage of my antidepressants for over 5 years now, and feel that how things are now is as good as it gets for me. I role play my way through my job, and my relationships, but when the masks come off, and the curtain goes down I am blank, emotionless, and lonely. It is almost time for me to go, I wish you all the best😔

"I empathise with you completely. It's quite astonishing that so many of us have found others who feel exactly the same way about life in this corner of the net.
Knowing how futile and inappropriate it is dishing out advice - the best I can offer is an ear to listen that understands completely. Most days I feel hopeless, joy is elusive though the best moments usually arrive when I'm with family - I'm only truly close with my immediate family and a few of my cousins who've known me since we were kids. I have never been able to hold on to any friendships for longer than it was convenient for the other person, perhaps I came across as distant too. I too can't stand small talk and am quite comfortable with silence - though I'm trying now to engage a bit more with other people by throwing out the odd question.
I pray you find purpose, I pray for it myself every day and am only now starting to see where I fit in this life equation at 30 - it's being revealed a little more each day.
I tend to compare myself to everyone I meet and feel pretty useless in my own eyes (it's bad, but it comes so naturally), but I have faint hope on bad days and hope on good ones that who I am is good for something or someone, somewhere.
It might not be a fluke that we've all found each other here.
A quote apparently not by Mark Twain, but traced to a passage from a book by Anita Canfield entitled, 'A Woman & Her Self-Esteem'
""Ask yourself a most profound question: “What are the two most important days in my life?” THE DAY YOU WERE BORN and THE DAY YOU REALIZE WHY YOU WERE BORN! And why were you born? You were born to bless the lives of others. You were born to make a contribution.""
(The above passage was tracked down by Matt Seybold of the Center for Mark Twain Studies)

"You seem like a really nice caring person and I can relate to what you say almost completely and especially the ""everything is pointless"" and ""my life ended some time ago"". I personally don't enjoy life like I feel I should I haven't really since I was 16 now 30 and I when really young subconsciously told myself as weird as it is that how happy I was as a kid is not going to last and that i feel i am going to die young anyway. (Surprised I am still alive tbh ) Anyway I feel we all have our paths pre set in life (Fate ) if you want to call it that and you can't change that but on this path we have 2 or possibly more directions given to us and this new direction takes up a portion of our lives until the next directions are given to us and what direction you choose to take doesn't matter meaning that if you choose to look after number 1 you'll get what you want from life but doing so you have to cut things out or people who you want to make happy or you feel obligated to help. The next direction is the opposite of what I said earlier the final one is give up and either stay on the path what your on and do nothing.
I know it's easy to tell people what will help them but you should find what you loved in life before you felt this way and if you find that answer and the answer is something that is no longer possible you now have the answer why you feel this way.
There really is no-one holding anyone back except ourselves even with responsibility like family or even if family is the problem work social life anything doesn't matter. The fact that there people who express the same emotions as you or me can only mean 2 things to me.
You have depression (I have depression) I feel blank but I think if you were on MEDS at any point for a lengthy period over 3 months they change you as a person it really messes with your brain chemistry more than anyone who studies will ever realize unless they experience it themselves. The good thing about this whether or not you were on meds is all these unfortunate feelings can be changed.
The hard part is quite easy all you have to do is what i said find what made you happy before then emulate it and if not possible then ask yourself why not?
People who do stuff or live a certain way because they see someone else enjoying and you don't that's not the life for you deep down you'll probably know this.
Life feels pointless because of death or of others death but it's not pointless everyday the person you see your gf or whoever is blessed to have you she sees in you what you see in her but regardless you need to find what you loved about life before you felt this way and s'ying i don't know is a copout really.
Feelings and emotions are only real because we allow them to be have you ever killed a bug and felt nothing ? You allowed yourself to feel nothing (It's not oh it's only a bug) You feel nothing because you allowed it be it because of ""It's Accepted"" by society or whatever. The feelings you have now are there because you've accepted them and/or were taken medicine. If you choose to be happy you will and I don't mean putting on a smile and ""Acting"" positive.
I don't know what you love to do or know what you want from life or what you loved in life before you felt this way only you can find this but your like myself and many others with the feelings.
I can't help you find this but i can suggest things that will kickstart and they start off very basic.
When you wake up run a bath not to hot sit back back enjoy the heat for a couple of minutes then very slowly run the cold water let it stay on until it's pretty cold but not freezing but enough where your not totally comfortable.
If you tried this let me know if you did?
Also know the world does have many people who genuinely care.

"I read your story with both understanding and sadness, having that same underlying and constant feeling that I long to be free of this life. It's not always been me though, I was a person with drive, leaving home at 16 and moving with conviction and belief that I could make a difference - I was a glass half full girl. I was the one throwing out all those verses that now drive me crazy, thinking, if they knew this pain, they wouldn't be saying, ""pull yourself together"", ""look at the bright side - You're smart, fit, ok looking and married"", or ""look at all who are worse off"". Truth is I don't know when or how my spirit just one day died, my will to get up every morning and have hope, to believe in myself and that I would ever have joy again, all just sizzled up. I forgave my husband for his 2 year affair with a sexy Cuban, it's not that, he stayed with me through it. I know I can work, and have lots of potential, but I can't even finish my writing jobs. When I go home to Australia or travel somewhere else in the world, and am in a safe environment with people who love me, I get a sneak glimpse into the Sally that could be, but I come home and it all falls to pieces. I wish I could say I know it gets better. I'm still hoping God will save me, that in some way I am going through a life lesson, and that I need to be totally cleaned of all that is me (all that I have come to believe is a burden on others and unappealing) and start over as a brand new person. I know God can do it, as I sure can't and that is the hope that keeps me going. I can't see myself having the power to solve this, and I get quite upset when my husband tries to fix me with his superficial niceness. I feel like a face a long long fence, too high to climb, too deep to dig under, and no doors as far as the eyes can see. Or like I""m playing a game of solitaire, and no matter how hard I try I know it's a no win.
So, in answer, in the end all we have is God. I long to see him and be in that glory, but I don't want to go there feeling like I have let him down and missed the opportunity to share what is good in me ( I know there must be something), to help even just one person, bring a smile to someone. Thanks for sharing openly and allowing all us others the safety and freedom to share our own path and support each other.

"That peace to which you refer is as beautiful as it is scary. It is something you can never tell anyone about or they will think you have lost your mind. It is so deeply rooted, you can't grasp it's source, how it suddenly replace emotion, hope, love, joy. If you told anyone in healthcare, you'd be put in a padded cell to protect yourself and that is terrifying because we are not crazy. I have always been a writer, able to express my feelings, in poetry particularly, but now I grasp with this peace to leave - I watch people living their lives with wonder, see them see me as a successful human being, and am bewildered. I do hope you, and I, grow old, that we can find the source of this evil peace, of this thing that has stolen our will to live or to try. I pray I will wake up and be a new person, I even pray something will happen to me, shake me into reality. I will pray for you too.

"Hi I totally get the peace thing as I have held it as my comfort blanket for many years now. What I always have done though is hold off making that decision by deciding every morning that today wouldn't be the day I would do it. I have held it off now for around 35 years. I was convinced I wouldn't make old bones either, but you know what I have - yes I am gobsmacked but there is a certain satisfaction to be found from that.
I faced a stark choice in my late 20's but chose to do everything in my power to make my life more to my liking - after all I had nothing to lose did I? The other was my comfort blanket which gave me the confidence to try and sort my life out if you see what I mean.
I decided I wanted to learn how to make friends (this had totally bypassed me before) so I watched other people, how they interacted and how they talked and behaved towards each other and started copying them adapting it of course to my own personality. At the same time I sought counselling. Well I learnt and started making friends. Then life just opened up for me and so many good things happened ie going to Uni, buying my first home etc. through to discovering a couple of passions which I still have in my life.
Funnily enough the more I learned the more I knew about myself and the less I wanted to take my own life. I am mainly glad I stuck around otherwise I would have missed some interesting times. If I can do this then so can you and the others. Don't give in until you have tried everything first - and I mean everything. x

"Hey. Ok - so first this is weird. My own Google search of despair has lead me here, to your post dated 3 years a go but currently relatable and compelling me to reply. I see many others felt the same and I'm glad to see your still alive even though I support anyones decision to do as they please with their lives. Whats made you hold on? Or rather how do you just live with it? Freud argued we have life and death instincts. What if some of us just woukd rather not be here? I resent having to think about my family and loved ones etc... they are not really here to support and understand now so why should i stay alive just to suit others? To stop their pain. What about my pain? I find life exhausting. So exhausting. I'd like to sleep now. I'd love for there to be a land of utopia where I could reside but unfortunately as with life there are no guarantees.
I think it's cool you're able to hold down a relationship. I never could. I've always had this feeling that I'm not meant for this world. And that's OK. Surely not everyone is. My soul does not connect with anything. Not even my family. Only with nature, the skies, the moon - anything solitary and all encompassing.
I don't know. Even i think im talking s**t sometimes. I've been on meds for about a year. Tried 4 before i found the one im on that doesnt have the horrible side effects the others had but i still feel numb and like a zombie at times. No interest or motivation. I wish i never, ever started them. Working out use to be my thing and it helps me loads but doc convinced me i needed to go on meds and now its like i cant get off them. Withdrawal was always so bad i had to go back on them. I hate the word 'suicide' as its connotations are brutal, negative, selfishness and 'crazy'. What if we are the 'normal' ones. We just don't fit into societies boxes. We beat ourselves up for not following their linear thought patterns.
I agree. What if this is just 'me'.
Oh yeah - are you still a teacher? Either way think you've found you're calling. Just look at all the people in this thread you are helping with your words. I feel comfort there's more like me

"I'm not even sure I have depression, I think this may just be 'me'.
I have always been pretty useless socially, but have had a normal upbringing, no horrible experiences, have gone through education fine and even got jobs but I've never enjoyed life, never really cared and normally feel like I'm not really worth anything and, inevitably enventually, will become a burden.
I'm not going to be dramatic and say I'm going to end it, it sounds so pathetic (no offence intended to anyone) but I have thoughts of 'going' or even dreams that I could die 'blamelessly' thorugh accident or illness. Selfish I know.
I have a cycle. Get job, put on confident easy going persona, get physically tired from doing that, lose energy to maintain job, focus on negative, leave job in some form (fired/quit). Friends are much the same, play easy going fun, can't keep it up, lose or push them away. Relationships, get attracted to ones who need help, help them in anyway I can, get to a point where I feel I am no more use so should go as they'd be ultimately better off.
So, currently I've quit my job as a teacher, couldn't take it - always something to improve and with my way of thinking that just sounds like constantly someone telling you you're useless (and it backing up your own thoughts anyway) but even though I liked aspects of my job I don't think I had a passion like I see in others. I felt I'd let everyone down so disappeared, my partner/ parents got me through immediate days after my sudden departure from work and saw Doc who was nice enough - put me on medication which seemed to do very little - even after a few months. In fact it only had negative side effects so about three weeks ago I stopped taking them completely. I also started seeing a CBT person about three/four session ago but this feels like it's doing nothing at all either, we talk, I'm honest as I can be but there is some element of being 'public' and putting on that face/ jokey responses.
I dip between a wish to not be around that is forever there and seems to be backed up with wholly logical reasons that people genuinely struggle to refute to absolutely crashing panic attacks/ given up when my 'theories' are proved.
I know this sounds odd, but I don't even have the will to get 'better', largely because I don't think I can. I am just 'me'. I am negative, boring and even if it is all just selffullfillng profecies - it's still me who has done that. I'm not blaming life, or others or anything else.
A lot of the posts I read on here seem to have good reason; PTS, loss, finances etc - does anyone have no 'good' reason?
I just feel I'm never going to be happy, I am soon to be much a burden on those around me (my gf) and that, in the long run, it'd be better for all if I just went. I know my family and gf love me - but time heals, life would get better and people move on. In the long run I'm sure it wouldn't effect my family and 100% sure my gf would be better off.
Not sure if there is an answer for this, just writing. I'm not angry, I'm not hurt, I'm not even sad as such, I'm just tired...

"First, I need to say thank you for your candid post. It truly is too bad such conversation is not valued and freely discussed with true support given in the family, in school, in the workplace and so forth but there is a time and place for all things. This forum, your words, gave voice to my feelings. I cherish and am nourished by such discussions! Instead of accepting one another as we are people want to fix us with medication or heap more stress on us by pushing us to leave our comfort zone and follow our dreams, goals and ambitions! Cast caution to the wind, risk your life, do what you have to to get ahead! I've been told I'm too nice as though it is a negative. I've felt crushed and inadequate by constructive feedback, advice and suggestions. I quit my job 6 years ago (retail shift manager)because of severe anxiety. I loved helping customers but was not leadership material. I am uneducated by the world's standards but I understand things pretty clearly. i have difficulty expressing myself which is very frustrating. My brain glitches and for the most part seems empty. I cant carry on a conversation because i dont seem to have many thoughts. I feel confused, drained, unworthy and stupid. Ive wanted to ""leave"" everyday for 15 years. I am clinically depressed and so are millions of other people. Ive analyzed and picked apart everything said to me and everything I've said to others. I've felt like a burden to my husband. Do I think my family will be better off without me? Not anymore but I used to. What helps me? Knowing that the way the world is set up is not conducive to good mental or physical health. Knowing that mankind as a whole is flawed. I feel unworthy and inadequate because I am... and so is every human. I know you have your views on religion and it's understandable because it has failed to do what it's designed to do which is to direct mankind to the true God. The hypocrisy, greed and complete disregard for what God wants has resulted in as you say the blind leading the blind. The most intelligent men on earth (scientists, doctors, engineers, lawyers, professors, political and relgious leaders, etc) have been unable to solve the very basic problems of mankind ie; wars, crime, violence, poverty, homelessness, hopelessness, disease, corruption, drug addiction, the list goes on endlessly. Its no wonder depression has increased by leaps and bounds. We'd be crazy not to be depressed. Those who are coping or appear to be handling things well (my husband included) have resigned themselves to the madness with such sayings as ""it is what it is"" and ""get yours"" oh and my favorite ""you think too much""...... There is hope, there are solutions, there are answers. Can you guess which Religion I am? It's also weird that since I joined my religion I became more depressed because I became more aware. Keep knocking, keep searching and praying. You will know the truth... you will be set free...... Sorry so choppy!

"I think religion plays a major role in mental health i tried to work out from the very beginning why this is affecting me tracing it all back and realised that i was brainwashed. I sometimes would rather not have known or rather not been told about God and whilst i believe there must be i'd have rather worked this out myself if i was ever going to. I have honestly thought about suing over this but i'd have more chance of winning the lottery. I asked my mother why i was put in a catholic school she replied because i was and whilst this made me angry because it was the exact answer i was dreading but expecting i don't blame her as i don't think a lot of people understand how it can negatively affect someones mental health.

"I agree that religion in the wrong hands is oppressive and can do much damage psychologically. Many have used religious books, traditions and institutions to dominate, harm and deceive others. I must admit that I tried to use the bible to get my family to do things my way on occassion,....It backfired! I've learned that the bible is a mirror for me to change me and only me. I am not suppose to read it with the hope of changing others. I can share what helps me but ultimately their life is their choice. God gave each person free will to choose whether we serve him or not. No one but God should judge our decision. Actually Jehovah God has given Jesus the authority to judge but I digress. : )
I was moved by your saying you don't blame your mom, even though what she said made you angry. No mom or dad would knowingly put their children in harms way. We really hope and believe we are doing what's best. Unfortunately most of what we know is taught to us by another imperfect human so results may vary.... Let God be found true though every man a liar. The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.
A spiritual gem that helps me cope with severe depression and
family issues:
Phillipians 4: 6, 7 ""Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God and the peace of God that excels all thought will guard your hearts and MENTAL powers by means of Christ Jesus.

you alone are the most high over all the earth.""

rsjg,
In my opinion, you are just responding to the accumulative effects of life (it's okay to blame life). Nearly all of us feel this way at times. Why else do you think that so many people have responded to your post? What we all have in common is the ""human condition"". But it's the way that you've described this state of depression...no one else has articulated it so well.
What that says to me is that you are:
* self-actualizing
* eloquent
* courageous
* emotionally intelligent
* emotionally honest (what you call ""negative""
* interesting! (boring people blather on about superficial topics, you are everything BUT superficial)
Not to mention giving. Your post indicates that you are indirectly asking for help. What you've ended up with is a bunch of people who want to commiserate with you, often making your post about themselves. And what did you do? You ended up counseling them!
You also mention eventually becoming a burden to your girlfriend. Okay, that might be true. But have you considered why your girlfriend is spending her life with you? It's quite possible that she sees the same qualities in you that I (and possibly others on this board) see. Meaning, you add value to her life too. If not, she would be just another friend who has distanced themselves from you.
I realize it's been several years since you've contributed to this discussion. I'm going to assume it's because it has become an energy drain on you, which would be very understandable.
But I do hope that you are still with us and that you're enduring life the best that you can. If so, realize that you have added a lot of value to our lives--and please feel proud of that.

"I have been re reading some of the comments here and what strikes me is how many of us feel empty and put a mask on. How we can't find any joy from life and just see it as a burden, and feel one on those around us.
I came across something called Childhood Emotional Neglect on the internet a couple of years ago and it immediately clicked for me. It is something which until now has been virtually ignored by mental health experts but is gathering pace now. It's to do with never learning to experience and deal with our emotions through a healthy and nurturing environment. Because of this we dampen down our emotions in order to survive then either have great problems learning to reconnect with them or are unable to completely.
According to CEN emotions are what connect us to ourselves and lead us to have a rich and fulfilling emotional life. The good news is you can to some extent teach yourself how to reconnect and I am doing this right now. Have a look at this and see if it can help you. I hope so. x

"Thanks hypercat. Really useful link. I think I experienced one or more of those things from my parents. They were both single children born in the Thirties from very traditional backgrounds and would have no access to the information we have today. I cannot blame them but have never had a close relationship with them. Interestingly my sister rebelled and was a bit wild and I sort of crumpled and shut down. She has a much wider life than me now with children and a partner, whereas I keep myself to myself more but we both have suffered with a depressive outlook and suicidal thoughts. Dunno about her as we aren't close (surprise) but mine continue. Just started really addressing things now, so thanks again for your help.

When I came across CEN by chance bells started ringing very loud and it describes my childhood to a tee. Now I understand the roots of my depression. I only wish I had known about it many years ago as my whole life could have been a lot better. x

"I'm not even sure I have depression, I think this may just be 'me'.
I have always been pretty useless socially, but have had a normal upbringing, no horrible experiences, have gone through education fine and even got jobs but I've never enjoyed life, never really cared and normally feel like I'm not really worth anything and, inevitably enventually, will become a burden.
I'm not going to be dramatic and say I'm going to end it, it sounds so pathetic (no offence intended to anyone) but I have thoughts of 'going' or even dreams that I could die 'blamelessly' thorugh accident or illness. Selfish I know.
I have a cycle. Get job, put on confident easy going persona, get physically tired from doing that, lose energy to maintain job, focus on negative, leave job in some form (fired/quit). Friends are much the same, play easy going fun, can't keep it up, lose or push them away. Relationships, get attracted to ones who need help, help them in anyway I can, get to a point where I feel I am no more use so should go as they'd be ultimately better off.
So, currently I've quit my job as a teacher, couldn't take it - always something to improve and with my way of thinking that just sounds like constantly someone telling you you're useless (and it backing up your own thoughts anyway) but even though I liked aspects of my job I don't think I had a passion like I see in others. I felt I'd let everyone down so disappeared, my partner/ parents got me through immediate days after my sudden departure from work and saw Doc who was nice enough - put me on medication which seemed to do very little - even after a few months. In fact it only had negative side effects so about three weeks ago I stopped taking them completely. I also started seeing a CBT person about three/four session ago but this feels like it's doing nothing at all either, we talk, I'm honest as I can be but there is some element of being 'public' and putting on that face/ jokey responses.
I dip between a wish to not be around that is forever there and seems to be backed up with wholly logical reasons that people genuinely struggle to refute to absolutely crashing panic attacks/ given up when my 'theories' are proved.
I know this sounds odd, but I don't even have the will to get 'better', largely because I don't think I can. I am just 'me'. I am negative, boring and even if it is all just selffullfillng profecies - it's still me who has done that. I'm not blaming life, or others or anything else.
A lot of the posts I read on here seem to have good reason; PTS, loss, finances etc - does anyone have no 'good' reason?
I just feel I'm never going to be happy, I am soon to be much a burden on those around me (my gf) and that, in the long run, it'd be better for all if I just went. I know my family and gf love me - but time heals, life would get better and people move on. In the long run I'm sure it wouldn't effect my family and 100% sure my gf would be better off.
Not sure if there is an answer for this, just writing. I'm not angry, I'm not hurt, I'm not even sad as such, I'm just tired...

"I pretty much understand where your coming from. I have felt like that since my divorce 12 years ago and the relationship I'm in right now really makes no sense at all to me.
I really think I would be better off gone since I have no one to start with to begin with.

"Thank you! That was helpful to read, and I do agree I am one who thinks about it, but would never be brave enough to do it, or ever that hopeless. I think perhaps it's just a means of reaching out for friendship and non-judgement. I only wish I were in the UK or Ireland, where the pressure to be young, beautiful, confident and extroverted is not as much a part of societal norms as it in here in California. Either that or back home in Australia with family.
I appreciate you caring enough to respond. Means a lot.

"Hi to all who post here and to rsjg who started this. Thank you for giving me this window to connect through. The lack of instruction on what to do is refreshing. And also important. My internal response is always, “don't tell me what to do about this, you don't understand”. Contradictorially (is that a word? Looks like one!) I have the same feeling even if I identify with what you say. So maybe I just want to be allowed to be like this. This is the beauty of rsjg's post for me.
I tend to push people away subconsciously. Unfortunately there are answers to this but my experience shows me that we will not keep it up. There are lots of answers but the only true answer is to accept who we are. Don't worry what everyone else thinks. Be grateful for what we have. Help others. If we do all that and keep it real we will be in a good place. Life is a journey, there is only one destination. So we have to enjoy the journey or change our mode of transport. I have tried a lot of fairly objective self analysis in a 12 step recovery programme (the addiction was not the problem, it was me) and I understand a lot of my problems and character flaws. But ultimately I will disconnect and look for negatives without some serious work, which I get tired of quickly. There is a lot of bad stuff in the world, our society seems to be fixated on wealth and not well being. There are some who think they are the same. We may disagree I think. On the other hand there are some who give and do wonderful things just naturally, I am not one of them, but i do try when I can despite my lack of altruism in doing it.
That is not to say hope can't creep in. We would not have carried on if we didn't allow hope at all. But hope seems to be easily crushed by our doubts and fears and apathy. The French have the word 'ennui' which seems to be the exact thing I suffer from. Tired of life. I have tried it the way other people do it, I have tried it my way, I have tried to balance them both and have achieved fleeting satisfaction but it is not sustainable for me. I revert to Default. Even as a child I remember responding to my parents with “can't be bothered”. After 58 years I am tired, I have several health issues and few friends, I thank God for a good day each day but cringe inwardly as I don't really feel that it was. Why do it then? Because there is still a little bit of hope. I try to run through the things which were ok and ask for help to do better tomorrow. It keeps me going.
I am not a great supporter of medication for this. All medication if taken in sufficient quantity to be effective is likely to have side effects. And this problem is so fundamental to us and such a product of our thinking that taking a pill does not seem realistic. Only my experience but I was totally unable to explain myself to a professional, I kept making things up and saying what I thought he wanted to hear.
Thanks to hypercat for mentioning CEN, I am sure it is something that has contributed to my problem but I am not keen on labels. It is too easy to say I am this or I am that, you must make me better. What is the point of a label with out effective treatment and a solution. At the end of the day 'it is what it is' and 'we are who we are'. I think we all react differently to life's difficulties some fight some run some just struggle. I endure, that is the truth and I hate saying it but accept it. From there I can move on. Probably to nowhere but hey-ho!
And rsjg, carry on being yourself and don't go beating yourself up too much. You say you have helped others and I am sure others accept you for who you are even if you think they shouldn't. It's up to them!
Thank you for letting me be who I am. Long-winded, self important, selfish, self obsessed, ungrateful, intolerant, negative . . . . and maybe human but a bit too much so!
PS hope you like me

"This is such an excellent comment, I also feel that rsjg posts have resounded so well across so many people and I'm one of them. Like you said all the posts here allow me to see that there are many who also have felt so tired of life despite unable to pinpoint a real dramatic event that has occurred in their life, furthermore there isn't a lot of comment on ""you should do this"", it's just a community telling one another about their story and how they feel, filled with all the human emotions. For me who also have lost any real purpose and tired of having to wake up to another day for at least 10 years now, I feel like at this point what I want isn't medication but instead someone to connect to. I mean I probably won't find a way to ""cure"" my thoughts but seeing I'm not alone made me just a bit happy, perhaps enough so that I can continue on a bit longer.

"I am so tired of life too. I will be 43 soon and I am sick and tired of the repetition, doing the same thing week in week out. Life has become so boring and meaningless. I do not want to change who I am or what I do...I just want to go to bed and never wake up. At this stage in my life I feel that I have done all that I wanted to do. As I get older I also find that I have become increasing tired of people, I put on a brave face but inside I just want to run a mile away from them. The pretense is wearing thin at this stage and I feel that it will only get worse. I also have a growing detest for the way we humans can and do behave towards each other and the way we treat the plant we live on. Turn on the news, read a newspaper, the injustice in this world is shocking, the lives that some people are forced to live is shocking and most people just do not care, the greed, the arrogance + much more...all of it turns my stomach and it makes me resent life. I dream of getting away from everyone and every thing and living a very quite secluded life...living like a hermit I guess...but of course this is not possible because of responsibilities and my financial situation will not allow it. I guess never waking up is the only true and permanent seclusion that is available to me now....hence why I crave it. I would never self harm or kill myself but I do not want to continue either. The more that I think about life, the more meaningless I see it. Whether you are rich or poor, happy or sad, healthy or sick .etc. it is all temporary and the same faith awaits us all...death. Graveyards are full of high achievers and billionaires. When you are dead you are no more so what you achieve in life becomes irrelevant to you...even if you did take pride in it while you were alive. I remind myself of this all the time, I find this very reassuring and it helps me to not take life too seriously. Life is a gift, for sure, but I wish the gift could be returned when you have had enough of it. Sorry for being so pessimistic but years of working hard, struggling, dealing with ass*oles, trying to fit in, repetition, worrying and seeing how we behave towards each other...has worn me out. I know that some people can just keep going and going no matter what but after 42 years I feel that the fight in me has gone....I gave it my best shot and I feel that I am entitled to bow out now. The occasional high that does come my way from time to time is fleeting and it does not give me any reason to want to continue anymore. The thought of hanging around for another 25+ years is depressing. I have never suffered from depression in the past but I feel that it is waiting for me around the corner....beam me up scotty....energize..darn...still here!

"Hi. I'm not gonna be saying a lot (hopefully) but.... just try. I know what you mean. And the best thing to do would be to try. Try to find the wonderful and beautiful things in everyday life. Know that YOU ARE NOT USELESS AND YOU MATTER TO E.V.E.R.Y.O.N.E. Whenever you think that you're not worth it, CHANGE THAT BAD THOUGHT AROUND TO ""I AM WORTH IT!"" Look yourself in the mirror and say ""I. AM. WORTH. IT"" and keep repeating it with emphasis. Doing this will eventually change your mindset...or at least I hope it would.
Your a beautiful specimen, no.... you're more than a measly specimen....you're a beautiful painite, precious, amazing, unique and rare gem. And you matter more than anything.
I love you dearly.... even if I don't know you. And I hope you one day see the beauty in the world and in yourself.
Sincerely and lovingly,
Jerrochan.

"I too am a burden to this. My Friends are the ones hard done by because they are always out having a laugh drinking, socialising and what have you but, lately for about 4 months o have kept pushing them away and not going with them. My family also regularly go out on a weekend but I to avoid it by staying at home or just going somewhere on my own. I want to escape it all the lifestyle I live in and especially my area but just to be free. Girls always seem to effect me negatively as they fall into love but I only hurt and don’t want to continue the story. My honest opinion is that the world would be a better place
Without me but I certainly don’t think taking my life is the answer to my problems. I don’t even know what to say. I’m tired of it like I want to fall into a put and lay there for eternity.

"Suicide not even close running away into the wood to live like a hermit might work but the a bear would eat us so not bad but painful. All jokes aside the only way ive been able to cope is day by day and staying away from family thry can be triggers and the worst in time of disstress.your lucky if ur not homeless yet. There is someone alwzys worse off. So for me anger inside anger that is rages on. Im angry at myself for letting myself fall this bad im angry at God a spirit so powerful it can create a universe and here we r suffering because a goverment and society has taken away our right to have a home on empty land. I could live ok on my own but in society people plot to ruine u if your to good at your job .now im jobless carless homeless. I have no reason to wake up anymore . It truly is killing me inside. Why should i bother getting better just so i can be knocked down again. I went through colon surgery survive that for this. I experienced the beauty and love pf God to only be left alone and sad beyond any measure. A hopeless people becaise even hope a fake coping tool has abandoned me. Even the universe that helped me see the whole picture revealed all of it to just leave me in a worse place than before i knew for sure this is a creation. So why cant he help me become a sucess to be a help to others a real help not a for profit help

"I almost tear up when I read your words as they are the words that are also in my heart and head. It's an awful place to be and we have to draw strength from each other that this is something bigger than us, and not worry if we don't particularly ""fit in"" or even want to ""fit in"". My life feels like a Stepford wives movie, where everyone is perfect and I can't get through to anyone, there's no transparency, live a vicious game that I can't find the door out of. How our heads can play games on us. Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade show us that wealth, popularity, success and fame do not buy happiness, nor do people telling us to ""be grateful"". I have no answer just to say, I feel your pain, and sincerely believe there will be an end to it. Mine has gone on for 5 years now, and I was always such a positive, happy, person.

"So to me it sounds like ur depressed because I think lots of people diagnosed with depression feel empty and purposeless.
my advice would be to find something you care about. so for me I would be like what do I want from life?
i want a purpose and I want to do something that will give my life vaule.
so as a random example f**k off to africa or the slums in India and help the dying children.
or ask yourself what has made you happy in the past? And what would give someones life purpose?
for me as an example a life with a purpose is a life that makes the world a better place.you could want to make a mark like writing a book.
but ask your self questions about you, about your dreams and your passions(if you don’t have any think about past passions or anything that may make you smile, switch things up).people who love you will respect what you want and allow you to do what you need to do to get better.
Hope this helpsxx

As for 'got better', I'm not sure you do. My view of it is a bit like alcoholics - you're always an alcoholic you're just x years sober. A person who has depression might be x years 'positive'!

"Hey. I just wanted to say that recently Ive been doing much better. For a little bit of a backstory,,, I went under the Holy Spirit when I was 14. That religious experience was very dramatic and I cant say that I necessarily became very religious after that experience. However in my late 20's I started reading Bible and touching my spiritual essence much more. Then not so much again. BUT, as of late I feel blessed and feel that for the most part I am practicing Gods will. Wanted to tell everyone here that is my experience.. I was in a suicide depression for over 8 months and I feel just as I write this a small hint of dread again, but like I said, something transformed in me and I wanted to share it ThankYou

"Words are just that. Im not trying to be rude to the ones giving great advice . But when your in a state of hoplessness words are just words. It helps to talk and have a person listen truly listen
There are no easy fixes and no easy words to a depressed individual. To push through day by day min by min is not a easy thing it takes courage determination and a will that refuses eveven thpugh the body is very weak . In most cases as was mine a underline health issue eas the cause. Having pain that puts u in a depressive state but not knowing thats what happened is very dangerous and painfull. Just hang in there it may not get better it might get bearable at best. Having purpose helps . Anything positive helps. But my words will not fix you nor will they ad hope at best you know your not alone and that is something to give support. I may be at the place u were or are. Talking and sharing the road traveled I believe helps. If you can find a group to vent like this where others are going through the same pain at least you know your not alone and we are not just spewing empty words . Our words have substance nutriance and life. They are not spoken from putty or a know it all point of view. our words are of the same dish of pain and suffering. I once heard if we are unable to love a person that has pastaway our sorrow is not of the loss but rather that we are unable to give the love we want to give that causes us sorrow. So in some cases your pain is causes by the fact u just want to love or be loved and have nothing to give and get. That in my opion is a good explanation of pain. Thank for listening and I truly love u all

"Hello, I feel the same way. I don't feel depressed or manic, I just feel that once I've had enough I see no problem with just ending myself. After all if you were at a party or a club or a bar etc, if you got bored, or didn't enjoy it you would leave, I have just applied this principal to life. I do not find the prospect of living to a ripe old age appealing at all, in fact the thought is horrifying to me. To end up in a chair surrounded by similar types having your bum wiped and being fed by a spoon because your to addled with some sickness to feed yourself - no thanks.
I haven't spoken about it to anyone, I cannot see the point, what would they do ""try and talk me down.."", why my mind is made up, it has been for several years I'm just looking for the time that suits me.
I honestly think there are a lot of people out there who feel the same way as well.

"i can relate. the thing is,you can't always believe what your mind says.AFTER YEARS, and i mean years,of therapy, i still have these days when i feel exactly as you describe.On those days,my mind gets locked into that same loop. "" oh whats the use , I'm 65 , ive raised my family,i no longer feel inspired by anything,there's never going to be anything new and exciting in my life,etc. I so easily see the logic in all that. BUT then i remind myself of how much i love a good laugh. Sometimes i can start imagining a comedian doing stand up about my life. My main relief is remembering , I m not always obligated to see me and my thoughts as being inseparable. and sometimes im reminded i am not my thoughts.and then ask myself ,""WHERE the heck did that come from?"" START MOVING START DANCING. i hope you don't mind my 2 cents, but honestly nothing ever stays the same.
I wish you peace and love and no expectations.Dale

"And yet here you are.
Yes it is a rather old post but doesn't mean people can't relate to it anymore. And it just proves that this is a major issue that should be addressed more.
